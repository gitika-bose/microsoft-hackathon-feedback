I found out that my fall semester classes are all going to be online. I usually like to print the PowerPoints and write on them but because I can‚Äôt print at school I can‚Äôt do that. I was thinking about getting a tablet to take notes on instead to save paper. Anyone have any recommendations?

(Edit): Oklahoma, at a Christian church summer camp   1. Sexual harrassment - His boss, ( B ) repeatedly humiliates, and practically gropes his secretary in front of his partners.  2. Moonlighting - B has a second job as a preacher, and uses company time and resources by forcing his secretary to type up hour long sermons and powerpoints on company time.  3. Missing payments - My friend sometimes doesnt get paid for 2-4 days after his contract states (he gets paid twice a month) That is because the secretary (who is already overworked) gets verbally harassed if she sends out checks without B's permission. B then "forgets" to tell her to pay the employees.  There are a lot more things B does that arent fireable, ( like double booking events without notifying anyone, and recently, personally ignoring most covid-19 precautions. ) but I need to know if he has any grounds to take legal action.
This post talks about how to use R to automate creating PowerPoint reports: 
So here‚Äôs the backstory. A few years ago, I was at Burger King with my  We were happily chatting away when suddenly, I remembered that I had to submit a piece of important homework which was I believe was physics. It was about a PowerPoint slide on the impacts on the environment caused by different sources of energy. Luckily, I usually brought along my MacBook Air with me in case I needed to do some work on it. So, I took it out and started typing away. I was about halfway done when an Entitled Kid with his Entitled Dad saw some games on my Mac and (as I can see in the reflection casted on the screen) excitedly pointed at my computer and whispered something to the ED. After a while, he walks to me and here‚Äôs how the conversation roughly went:  ED: Excuse me, can you let my son play on your computer for a while?  Me: Uh...Why?  ED: He‚Äôs bored and has nothing to do.Me: Can he play on your phone instead?ED: My phone isn‚Äôt suitable for gaming as it is quite old and tends to crash a lot.  Me: Sorry but I‚Äôm busy with an urgent project that needs to be handed in to my teacher ASAP. Sorry but I can‚Äôt let him play on my Mac.  ED: I don‚Äôt f\*\*king care. He can do whatever he wants. He‚Äôs still a kid. Just let him play!  Me: Sorry sir but as I said, I‚Äôm busy with homework that needs to be handed in urgently so for now he can‚Äôt play.  ED: Oh come on. It‚Äôs just homework. Not doing it won‚Äòt get you expelled.  Me: Don‚Äôt you get it. Although it does not expel me, it is counted in my exam results so I really have to do it.  The ED then started screaming at me and in the process said a bunch of obscene words. It would be a R-rated conversation but I‚Äôll try to keep it at PG.  ED: Listen you a\*\*hole, I‚Äôm a f\*\*king adult and you‚Äôre just a stupid kid. So you do as you say and give him your laptop to play otherwise I will destroy your laptop! Give it to him now you c\*\*\*.  Me; (losing my patience) EXCUSE ME, THE WORLD DOES NOT BELONG TO YOU! I HAVE ALL RIGHTS TO NOT LET YOUR CHILD USE MY COMPUTER. SO PLEASE, LEAVE ME ALONE!  The ED then proceeds to grab my MacBook and with all his might, smashed it onto the floor as if he were some sort of He-Man or something. That laptop was smashed into pieces. Everybody who saw this was shocked as h\*\*\*.  Me: LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO MY MAC! YOU ARE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS!  ED: SO WHAT B\*\*\*\*? I‚Äôm a f\*\*king adult and therefore you should f\*\*king respect me. Now, stop trying to argue with me or I‚Äôll call the f\*\*king police.  Me: Go ahead you f\*\*king d\*\*\*. It‚Äôs your fault anyways.  ED: (calls the police) WHO THE F ARE YOU CALLING D\*\*\* STUPID?  We proceeded to argue back and forth until the police arrives.  P1: Uh sirs, what is going on?  ED: He destroyed my Macbook and now he‚Äôs saying that it wasn‚Äôt his fault!  EK: Yeah. He was just swearing and arguing with my dad for no reason.  P2: (talking to random staff) Check the CCTV footage.The 2 policemen went with the staff into the surveillance room. After a while, the policemen came out and said:  P1: (talking to ED) Sir, we have found that you were being a nuisance to that person and you were the one who smashed the computer. I‚Äôm sorry but you‚Äôll need to follow me to the police station. We might need to prosecute you for being a public nuisance and destroying other people‚Äôs property.  When the ED heard this, he picked up a nearby chair and threw it at me. It missed me but hit a nearby staff‚Äôs legs, probably severely injuring him as he could not walk. He then started punching and kicking me so hard that it felt Ike he had just became Hulk. The EK joins in as well, throwing items within his reach at me. Before I blacked out, I saw the police tasing him and managed to handcuff him.  I woke up in the hospital a few hours later, with my body wrapped up in bandage. I later heard from the police department that the ED was sentenced to 18 months in jail and 130 hours of community service for violent assault and being a public nuisance. As for me, spend about a week or so in the hospital before being discharged. Luckily, I was not physically disabled after this incident so I can still walk, run and do what a normal person can do.  So yeah, that is my story. Hope you enjoyed it.
Hi,  Bit of a stupid question but do any of the Sydney Ferries have PowerPoints on them?  Cheers
I downloaded a .PPTM file and once I opened the file, I received the following message:  **Some controls on this presentation can't be activated. They might not be registered on this computer.**  It also said it was not able to transfer all the macros.  The .PPTM tile has ActiveX Element: Label. It has a few trigger animations and macros to manipulate the Label.  Please advise on how to proceed. I am using PowerPoint 2019 on macOS.
Questions re: hacker response approach: Any reco. strategies for getting MiTM hacker to stop?   Or just give me a break? Don‚Äôt have deep pockets so I think they‚Äôre just trying to make my life difficult (see below for possible reason) ...is it possible to send them a message or something? I know it‚Äôs naive to think something like that would work but I‚Äôm out of ideas (and out of 2 laptops already).   How do I wave the white flag or discuss what it would take for them to stop? I honestly don‚Äôt even care about the passive monitoring anymore (which is what they started w/)...I just want to be able to access my emails, powerpoint and my Xbox  ‚Äî-  Please see below for full context. And Apologies for the ‚Äòstraight to the point‚Äô writing style. ....this post is coming from a sleep-deprived netsec noob that‚Äôs feeling defeated &amp; desperate and now a little delirious too I guess ha ü•¥ thx in advance for any help  Background: I‚Äôm getting my butt kicked by what I suspect is a MiTM attack. I have reason to believe it started on work network and I brought it to my home network (if that‚Äôs even possible).  The hacker(s) were fairly passive, save for a large sum wire fraud trans. at my startup. We thought it was phishing at 1st but some other symptoms led me to believe our issue was more invasive  I guess I made the mistake of trying to identify and understand our netsec issues.   About 10 days ago, I told my work team &amp; family about the suspected network attack. The remote user has been proactively shutting me out of all my devices &amp; Accts. And my texts &amp; calls are being intercepted and spoofed. Also learned that they have physical versions of my atm and credit cards...they intercepted the re-issues debit card somehow. And they won‚Äôt even let me pay down the CC via online or telephone banking b/c those connections are also getting intercepted  Anywho my co is working on a enterprise wide fix + trying to coordinate with authorities. So that‚Äôs underway albeit we know we won‚Äôt have solutions anytime soon. We‚Äôre a startup full of noobs and it doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm the only being actively bothered lol no one shares my sense of urgency   So I‚Äôm really just asking how I can get the hackers to stop actively hacking me. What would it take to go back to the passive approach??
i am currently taking A+ cert, and my instructor is not able to share the powerpoints with us. does anyone have access to the PowerPoint slide for the Mike Meyers 6th edition for managing and troubleshooting PCs?
Hey guys! Just wanted to get your opinion on what's the best tablet for taking notes on a Mac (maybe on OneNote?? also taking suggestions for different programs). I considered the iPad/Apple Pencil briefly but if I'm just trying to annotate PowerPoint slides, I couldn't really justify spending that much.    I'm looking most for palm rejection, smooth writing, etc. Please also list some good ones you think are more affordable (if not the same price range as "the best") if any come to mind.
Zoom can share Ubuntu's desktop. For teaching, I want to show (1) webcam (2) powerpoints (3) software; but preferably nothing else. I would like to remove the top window bar and the dock; but they should reappear also when I need them. Also, I want to present my webcam and powerpoints frameless (no bars on the top or sides), but I also want to keep usability. Any suggestions from you experts about what my best bet here might be?
I appreciate if the slides are posted somewhere after the presentation where you can review them after, especially if there is extra content or external links to more information. But I‚Äôve had so many presenters highlight how there is no reason to take notes on the presentation because the slides will be available after the presentation. Taking notes keeps me focused and engaged, and I don‚Äôt always want to take an extra hour reviewing every lecture I sit through once I go home when a few quick notes will jog my memory of the highlights.
Hey guys,  I've been planning to go fully remote with my employer recently and as a result have done plenty of research. Though I'd share some of my takeaways, enjoy :)  \-----  Tim Ferriss may be best known for inspiring a new generation of entrepreneurs, but in his book The Four Hour Work Week, he also lays out an effective strategy for employees to gain leverage and negotiate remote work.  He frames the discussion around the following question:  ‚ÄúHow do you train your boss to value performance over presence?‚Äù  You need to be able to show them that you get better results outside of the office. This means that not only do you have to get better results, but you also have *to measure these results*.  Your results should show that your remote work output is higher than your in-office output.  **Documentation**  The easiest way to do this is to document some metrics that do a good job of representing your performance.  If you work in customer success like me, this might just be account growth over a quarter - if I can prove that my accounts grew 20% more whilst I was working remotely than in the office, I have leverage. Of course, there‚Äôs going to be multiple other variables that impact this metric, but the key is to find the best one and prove you‚Äôve increased performance.  If you‚Äôre a mechanical engineer, this might come down to the number of designs per day that you‚Äôre producing. If you can prove that working remotely enables you to produce three more designs per day and three hours of additional billable client time, then you have leverage.  If you‚Äôre a more experienced employee and a large part of your job involves onboarding new hires, you might mention enhanced productivity in regards to training these new employees and getting them ready to contribute as fast as possible.  You get where this is going. Identify a quantifiable performance related goal that you can measure. Prove that you perform better when working at home. This is harder for some jobs than others, but if you‚Äôre in any sort of environment in which KPIs are used, that‚Äôs a good starting point.  Keep in mind that having a .  Any questions and I'll be in the comments :)

Hey guys i will be going into my first year of business school and I am looking for a good laptop to buy that can last me at least four years, I will be doing a little bit of video editing, powerpoints, and obviously note taking. My budget is anything under $2000, preferably around $1500. Thanks in advance guys.
Title. I have been using Microsoft Office 2011 since I got my MacBook Pro in 2013. Recently I noticed that it is very slow and can be glitchy at times, which makes sense as it is a 9 year old software. As I only need office apps for very basic needs (e.g., proofreading documents from work, some PowerPoint presentations, etc.) I was looking into the free options available. I have been messing around with both iWorks and LibreOffice.  I want to like Pages more than LibreOffice, however, it seems like LibreOffice gets the formatting of MS Word documents spot on most of the time while Pages always seems to be a little off. I do like KeyNotes better than the "Power Point" on LibreOffice. At the end of the day I'll probably just end up using a mixture of the two.  I guess I was just curious as to what others think about the two office apps. I appreciate any replies!
Basically: I‚Äôm debating buy a new MacBook  Current MacBook: MacBook Pro 13‚Äù mid-2012 bought new in 2014. 2.5 GHz intel i5 4GB RAM. Battery health app says it has 49% capacity and is just under 1500 cycles.  It has good days where it runs smooth. But the bad days are bad. It moves so incredibly slow and runs hot and seems like it is working so hard and a few times it has even self restarted on me. Of course these days are usually when something important is happening like online class. I‚Äôve also had a scare recently where I thought it died during quarantine but after a half hour I was finally able to get it back on and haven‚Äôt had any similar issues since. (I‚Äôm also tired of having to buy almost $100 MagSafe chargers when they give out too)  What I use it for: mainly school (I‚Äôm in grad school earning my DPT and have 2 years to go). I use google drive for assignments and downloading class PowerPoints and also taking notes for certain classes. Also in these times it involves zoom class meetings. I tend to watch a lot of YouTube that involves many tabs. And very occasionally play Sims 4 and Toontown.  Options:  1. New 2020 intel MacBook Pro 13‚Äù base model     1. I‚Äôm concerned about heating issues (hence why the air has been nixed) and support not lasting as many ‚Äòyears‚Äô as people say    2. I‚Äôm pulled in by the current AirPods deal at the education store 2. New apple silicon MacBook Air or pro    1. I‚Äôm concerned about it being a 1st gen product 3. Crazily wait for 2nd gen apple silicon MacBook    1. I‚Äôm concerned about this timeline  Obviously if my MacBook dies in the meantime I will just buy one no problem. But after so many videos and reading so many thoughts these past couple weeks I still feel lost on what choice is best and would like any and all input
This 5 week anatomy and physiology class has definitely kicked my butt. It's taught me I really need to learn how to retain and study better. Im doing okay but Im really just going all out to do my best and constantly feel like Im barely keeping my head above water. I bought Anki and I think Anki is awesome but it's going to take a little practice to figure out how to use optimally. But within a 5 week class it just takes too much time to make good decks. I usually just look up pre-made quizlet decks and hope for the best. My main question today is what is the best way to learn and retain information from a slide. For example, lets say out of your class powerpoint, you have a slide (probably have 50-70) but lets just focus on one for now; this slide has 5-6 pieces of information on here you should memorize. What is the best way to get all this to memory and then do the same for all the other slides? If it‚Äôs Anki, how are you setting up your questions? I know we all learn differently, I just want to hear some ideas.
I‚Äôve realized that I have thin skin. Rude behavior or harsh criticism obliterates my motivation. (I went into the wrong field, I know.)  So when picking a specialty, I‚Äôd like to minimize my chances of running into assholes. What specialties in your opinion have the nicest or meanest attendings?  I realize that much of this is team and institution dependent, but based on my clinical rotations, here are my impressions:  Nicest:   **Pediatrics**:Residents were really great, and there was an extremely good system during my clinical rotation for giving constructive feedback in a manner that wasn‚Äôt demeaning.  **Psychiatry**: Attendings seemed to enjoy my presence, which is more than I can say for most specialties. Unfortunately the clerkship director for Psychiatry at my school is known to be cruel, and berated my friend for asking for a ‚Äúmental health‚Äù day off for panic attacks.  Meanest:   **Neurology**: I had an attending that rolled her eyes at me when I said I thought a patient with pulmonary hypertension had Bell‚Äôs Palsy and not a stroke. She was extremely defensive about her decision to admit the patient for a stroke, and had me present the next day on the relationship between pulmonary HTN and stroke (on which there wasn‚Äôt much literature.) By the way, the patient had Bell‚Äôs Palsy.   **Medicine**: Cried in the bathroom after being humiliated for not answering a number of pimp questions correctly. Also, this is another clerkship known to have a really cruel course director.  **Surgery**: Most of the abuse I witnessed on this rotation was not directed towards medical students, but to residents. I watched my preceptor absolutely humiliate a resident giving a Grand Rounds Morbidity and Mortality presentation, calling his PowerPoint trash in front of the whole room.  **OB/Gyn**: Honestly, not as toxic as I was expecting. Biggest problems were stressed interns taking out their frustrations on medical students by yelling at us or straight up ignoring us, but once the stress passed, they were generally nice. In past years, this was known as the most toxic rotation at my school but I think they‚Äôve made an effort to change.  What have your experiences been? Rant here!
Today I happy cried because I don‚Äôt have to see my toxic parents until at least next year thanks to the current travel ban  As an only child, in my opinion, it‚Äôs difficult to cut your parents off. My parents were always physically and emotionally abusive so we‚Äôve never had a good relationship although my mother thinks we have a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù relationship. Anyway, I was messaging my dad (who I get on with a lot better than my mother) about random stuff before I asked when it was looking like they were coming over. To which I got the greatest response I could have asked for ‚ÄúThe non travel ban is currently upto the 31st December. An exemption to that is parents of permanent resident holders but they have to be single and under 21. So we're currently waiting until 1st January. Problem is it maybe extended‚Äù and I burst in to tears because I was so relieved.   A few weeks ago I sent them a PowerPoint about my mental illnesses and they‚Äôre still very anal/not understanding of what I‚Äôm actually going through as a result of the trauma I went through   I‚Äôm currently medicated (which they hate) and progressing with therapy. Knowing that I am able to continue the work on my mental health and be without any issues is such a blessing. I cried because I‚Äôm safe for longer and free of negativity. I am so thankful and overjoyed that I can continue to progress and be happier  This is just what I needed to make me realize all the pain and suffering has been worth the battle to be better

Since high school, I‚Äôve known that I‚Äôm not an auditory learner. Going to lectures where profs simply read off the powerpoints does nothing for me and is a waste of time that I could be using to study on my own and actually learn. Are PHYSL 210 lectures just the profs reading ppts, or do they test stuff that is talked about in lectures but not in the ppts/textbook? Thanks!
Edit: Also forgot to mention my actual major, lmao, Software Engineering. So I can also help with programming, specially in C, C++ and Java.  That‚Äôs right, I can do all of the above!

I have my own designs and templates.  - Great knowledge of Word, PowerPoint and Excel. Can do graphs, pivot tables, dashboards, macros, etc.  And basically anything along those lines. My fee will vary on the type of job, time invested and length or work. The standard is $0.03 per words for writing tasks. Many redditors have worked with me in the past and are pleased with my work. Bid and PM me for more info!
Since this years pledgeship will be different from other years as events will be limited, what advice can you give on how to memorize people‚Äôs names? I figured making a powerpoint would be the easiest, feel free to leave suggestions

I am currently working in a new job I started in March. I am an ‚Äúoffice assistant‚Äù but my job entails so much more than what is in my office JD. The pay I get is average for an office assistant but I don‚Äôt feel like it is accurate for what I actually do in the role, here is everything I currently do on a daily basis:   Manage the CEO and operational director‚Äôs diary, organise and prioritise daily workload, make appointments, coordinate reservations, send RSVPs to events and schedule and assist with meetings as necessary ‚Ä¢ Complex and seamless international meeting organization across different time zones ‚Ä¢ Document production using MS suite including advanced formatting and embedding in word, powerpoint and excel ‚Ä¢ Main contact for 30 + nurse contractors ‚Ä¢ Managing payroll for 30+ nurse contractors ‚Ä¢ Formatting and file management of patient files and medical records ‚Ä¢ Managing expense reconciliation and finance logs for office staff of 10. ‚Ä¢ Allocation of nurse contractors into patient jobs ‚Ä¢ Management of mandatory training requirements and tracker for nurses and employees ‚Ä¢ Build and maintain strong relationships with UHNWIs ‚Ä¢ Draft and prepare presentations and correspondence for staff members ‚Ä¢ Assist and lead on new starter onboarding ‚Ä¢ Carry out compliance audits to ensure we are meeting regulatory requirements outlined by CQC  There are many jobs that have the same duties but pay 50% more.   So here is my dilemma:   A) do I stay in my role and try to negotiate? My new ‚Äúboss‚Äù, who started last week and I have been training,  does the EXACT same role as me and earns 40% more (she has no extra experience in the industry than me).  B) stick out the job, get the experience even under the title of ‚Äúoffice assistant‚Äù and then move to higher paying role in 1/2 years   C) move industry completely into legal industry (which I am currently studying online)   Any advice would be appreciated!   Thanks
Explorative, superficial dates are fine, but if you want someone to be your SO, you need to have a job interview with them, including questionnaire and powerpoint presentation.
In my PowerPoint it‚Äôs spelled ‚Äúepitheliod‚Äù and ‚Äúepitheloid‚Äù, which one is right??? When I google it I get ‚Äúepithelioid‚Äù which never appeared on the presentation and seems to be referring to something else... please help!!

Hi, I am part of a group currently planning frosh for our faculty. Part of frosh includes mandatory presentations to the entire class at once (250ish people). Because of the current coronavirus pandemic, frosh is going to be online, and by extension the presentations. We have started working on a discord server where we will host all of the networking and mingling activities, but we are still looking at how to best deliver the mandatory presentations. We have set up a voice channel, with permissions set such so that only a specific user is able to speak and share video, while everyone else can only join and listen. Would it be possible to deliver the presentations in a live-stream fashion to at least 200 students in a manner similar to twitch? Video will be necessary, powerpoint presentations are going to be provided as well.

Hi,  I made my first attempt at a Youtube video sometime this summer, 6-8 weeks ago. Won't post here for anonymity unless advised, then I'll come back with an alt. It was political commentary although not too inflammatory, I don't think. I've left it public and a few of my friends like it, but my channel hasn't grown at all and I think the video was ignored.  I faced 3 issues:  * I tried to quote an extended passage from the book I was commenting on (3-5 pages or so?) This might have been too long for viewers to follow, and also I was worried about copyright fraud etc. One friend said that it was interesting but possibly too 'academic' and that I probably needed to teach the ideas and thinkers discussed in the video from scratch rather than assuming the audience knew what the author was talking about  * I was ad libbing my initial thoughts, which meant it got a bit long and rambling (40 mins, which is probably too long for a first video)  * I don't know how to do video production or editing, so there were e.g. no Powerpoint slides, no music, no opening or outro and so on. I used Windows Camera and I didn't know how to superimpose videos or sound onto it...meaning it was literally just me, the camera and my book.  After all of this and initial feedback, I was hesitant to post again as I feared that my channel would repeat what thousands of others have said. So I got writer's/artist's block and have left it to rot since, but haven't given up on it entirely. It's just the initial hurdle of not treating videos as a place for me to info dump and expect the audience to be able to follow, that's going to be hard to overcome.  Even though I'm fairly solid on my subject matter, I'm obviously a complete beginner on the technical aspects of Youtubing, so any tips you'd have are appreciated.
Hi, I hope this is the right place to ask. I want to create interactive online lessons for professionals. My background is filmmaking and graphic design. I love PowerPoint for presentations but what would I use to create lessons with tests? I‚Äôm good at InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro etc but not so hot with After Effects. I‚Äôm happy to learn another program - any ideas? Thanks very much!

Just wanted to share my mock-up of Long Yun's NPA flag. Might be a little off proportion wise, (I just use MS Paint and Powerpoint, and any elements I can get from Wikipedia lol), but I'm happy how it came out.

Hey guys,  I've been planning to go fully remote with my employer recently and as a result have done plenty of research. Though I'd share some of my takeaways, enjoy :)  \-----  Tim Ferriss may be best known for inspiring a new generation of entrepreneurs, but in his book The Four Hour Work Week, he also lays out an effective strategy for employees to gain leverage and negotiate remote work.  He frames the discussion around the following question:  ‚ÄúHow do you train your boss to value performance over presence?‚Äù  You need to be able to show them that you get better results outside of the office. This means that not only do you have to get better results, but you also have *to measure these results*.  Your results should show that your remote work output is higher than your in-office output.  **Documentation**  The easiest way to do this is to document some metrics that do a good job of representing your performance.  If you work in customer success like me, this might just be account growth over a quarter - if I can prove that my accounts grew 20% more whilst I was working remotely than in the office, I have leverage. Of course, there‚Äôs going to be multiple other variables that impact this metric, but the key is to find the best one and prove you‚Äôve increased performance.  If you‚Äôre a mechanical engineer, this might come down to the number of designs per day that you‚Äôre producing. If you can prove that working remotely enables you to produce three more designs per day and three hours of additional billable client time, then you have leverage.  If you‚Äôre a more experienced employee and a large part of your job involves onboarding new hires, you might mention enhanced productivity in regards to training these new employees and getting them ready to contribute as fast as possible.  You get where this is going. Identify a quantifiable performance related goal that you can measure. Prove that you perform better when working at home. This is harder for some jobs than others, but if you‚Äôre in any sort of environment in which KPIs are used, that‚Äôs a good starting point.  Keep in mind that having a .   Any questions and I'll be in the comments :)
Hello all!  I am looking into purchasing a new laptop and am not really sure what to consider. The one I have now is getting old and is very large and heavy.   I don‚Äôt really do anything fancy with my computer. I‚Äôm a kindergarten teacher in Thailand and mostly use it for lesson planning, watching videos with my students (YouTube), class dojo, Pinterest, emails, making/printing worksheets, and designing newsletters and weekly bulletin board updates for parents to see at pickup.   The thing I‚Äôm most worried about with the chromebook is that I don‚Äôt think Microsoft office will work on it (last year I relied heavily on PowerPoint which I prefer to google slides and I also use Word pretty much everyday, but I think I could manage to adjust).  Looking for anyone who has experience using a chromebook and how they like it, as well as any suggestions for alternative laptops. Looking for something user and budget friendly, and easily portable.  Thank you in advance for any help! (I‚Äôm pretty hopeless when it comes to technology).

Anyone have a PowerPoint or presentation about Cadet email safety and regulations I could use to get information and ideas from? I‚Äôm coming up short of anything for one I‚Äôm doing currently.
Trying to decide if I should get an iPad and a cheap laptop or a higher end laptopn/maybe a 2in1.   LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE  Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:  $1300ish USD  Are you open to refurbs/used?  No  How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?  Build quality, Performance, weight, battery life  How important is weight and thinness to you?  An 8 out of 10  Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put  14+ for laptop  Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.  No. I consume media and use office programs.   If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?  N/a  Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?  I love the feeling of a good keyboard. Reliable build quality is a factor.   Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.  My iPad died and I'm losing my work computer as I was laid off. Had the Dell XPS 13 thru work and liked it for work and liked the 2in1 possibility and that it folds to a tent or to fit in my tablet stand. but it was laggy with video.   I am deciding between a nicer laptop that I can also use to consume media, and getting an iPad and a cheaper laptop since I use a computer for PowerPoint and word and Excel and internet. Or do I get an iPad pro and a nice keyboard? Too many options.   Thanks for any guidance! I'm endlessly comparing specs and overwhelmed with options.
This is something I've been working on for about 12-18 months. I started my current job about 2 years ago, building self-paced eLearning for K-12 educator training. Coming from higher ed, where I developed courses with faculty and did some strategic innovation work, I was surprised to see how a lot of self-paced eLearning wasn't that great.  This led me to start researching. I read eLearning and the Science of Instruction, Michael Allen's book, and a few other things.  Articulate seems to be the leader here, but very little about what I see featured on their site seems that interesting to me. Instead of a powerpoint, the design tends to be a character reading or narrating something that is powerpoint like. Templates seem a little boring. Gamification seems gimmicky. Adaptivity makes sense, but its all still pretty linear. Then there is the question of accessibility - oh boy.  Yes, lots to digest.  How do you define self-paced eLearning?   I will be presenting on this at a conference in Madison, WI in a couple weeks and so am interested in what some folks on this group think.   Thanks!
Why is it so hard for people to communicate with each other? One of my classes for the summer semester requires students to be in a group together. All of the assignments must be done as a group.   The whole semester was a shit show. Two of our group members lacked communication and they would occasionally end up doing someone else‚Äôs part of the work or something completely different. One guy usually does his part of the work last fucking minute and we never get a chance to review what he‚Äôs done.   We‚Äôre currently doing the final project. I did my portion of the work which was 27 pages in a word document. I finished 5 days before the deadline. One group member wasn‚Äôt able to access the document. I was kinda irritated but I brushed it off because he was one of the few people who actually does work and has good communication with the rest of the team. Another team member finished a PowerPoint so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about that.  I was irritated when one of the fuck-ups did the wrong part AGAIN. I had to correct his bullshit. On top of that, he made the text rainbow colored. What the fuck man, this isn‚Äôt an elementary school art project. He also made a whole separate PowerPoint which made no sense. The other fucking weirdo went ahead and put the word documents into a PDF (when I clearly stated that I would handle this part) without sorting the pages so the title page and table of contents were both around the 30th page.   My luck with group projects is terrible and I hope I never have to do some shit like this again.  I‚Äôm not sure if any of those guys use Reddit but if they do and they see this post, just know I never want to fucking work with you again.
I there, I'm looking for someone to finish out the last 3 assignments I have for my humanity course. I've just been too depressed and lost my fire to finish out the course. I have an A and I'd like it finish out with it. 2 of the assignments you will need to watch a film. One is watching the film then write 2 paragraphs (due tomorrow 7/27 11:59PM Pacific), the other is watch and create a powerpoint. The final assignment is a reflection about the course, I'd like for it to be completed by you, but I'll do it if I have to. I extremely prefer if you've taken some kind of Hispanic culture or history course so the information comes easy to you and is accurate. The professor is a hard grader. I will send more information if interested. Thanks
Hello fellow teachers!   I am a newly graduated education student and during quarantine, I had a lot of time to kill. Therefore, I have put together a large folder on my computer with resources/handouts/Powerpoints/classroom decor, etc. for all grade levels and subjects as I do not know yet what I will be teaching. This folder is taking up way too much space on my desktop so I was wondering if there is a site out there where I can upload them all in an organized matter and where I can access them easily? I have put the folder on USB keys as well but those fill up fast as well. Let me know what you use or what you recommend.  Thank you all in advance!

So as we all know games 2-4 still remain untranslated aside from having an old school guide next to you as you play.  I am curious though if it would be feasible to instead of going into the code and replacing the English text which caused a lot of headaches to the team of the first game to just replace all the text boxes with  screenshots of the game that have the translated text pasted over them. Almost like an interactive PowerPoint since these game‚Äôs are visual novels   Would it end up making a game that takes up way too much storage space?

One is watching the film then write 2 paragraphs (due tomorrow 7/27 11:59PM Pacific), the other is watch and create a powerpoint. The final assignment is a reflection about the course, I'd like for it to be completed by you, but I'll do it if I have to. I extremely prefer if you've taken some kind of Hispanic culture or history course so the information comes easy to you and is accurate. The professor is a hard grader. I will send more information if interested. Thanks
Where to store digital handouts/resources?Hello fellow teachers!   I am a newly graduated education student and during quarantine, I had a lot of time to kill. Therefore, I have put together a large folder on my computer with resources/handouts/Powerpoints/classroom decor, etc. for all grade levels and subjects as I do not know yet what I will be teaching. This folder is taking up way too much space on my desktop so I was wondering if there is a site out there where I can upload them all in an organized matter and where I can access them easily? I have put the folder on USB keys as well but those fill up fast as well. Let me know what you use or what you recommend.  Thank you all in advance!
TIFU by showing up a Nude photo on my presentation at workHello people of r/tifu  I'm writing this on my throwaway account, I was always looking at posts on this subreddit and I thought "Well, I wouldn't want to be in that situation" and I think I spoke too soon  I got on a Zoom call with my work-mates and it was my turn to present something that would benefit the company, I don't want to share too much where and what project I was working for, just imagine some slideshows of ideas, profits, losses, risks and all the good stuff.  Nothing wrong there, however just one night before that, I was working on my slideshow with Microsoft Powerpoint I found some good photos online that would help my colleagues understand where I'm going with my point and etc I saved them on my desktop because I was in a hurry to go to sleep.  That's when I decided why not rub one out to some subreddits, I found a good spot screenshoted a photo and I accidentally replaced it with the photo that I was going to show on the presentation, I thought to myself "Ahhh, All good I'll do it tomorrow"  So when Powerpoint can't find the original photo to me at least it shows like a missing file error, when you override a picture with the same NAME.png (let's say as an example) it changes it on the project too.  For some reason I completely forgot about it, and when it was time for me to switch a panel with my right arrow key the next day, there it was the nude photo I saved just one night ago on the subreddit, I quickly gasped and turned off the Screen capture. I was extremely embarrassed there were Women too on the call (My boss, everyone) I apologized to everyone as fast as I could even when the call ended, I spent minutes telling everyone of  TL;DR I accidentally showed a Nude photo to my presentation instead a photo of what could been useful. in other words I hope you are all doing fine and laugh at me being a fucking dumb person.

I can't understand why our organization's Epic implementation/training is always so horrible....Hi guys:  I have worked as a nurse close to 15 years at one of the largest healthcare systems in Southern California. This organization owns hospitals and a TON of urgent care centers and clinics.  I work at one of the main hospitals next to the beautiful beach. Unfortunately, despite the beautiful environment, the implementation of EHR has been a nightmare.  **Epic Implementation for the Inpatient Side**  When our leaders said that they would start to transition into Epic for the inpatient side of our healthcare system, I was excited. However, they then told us that we would be utilizing another healthcare system's instance of Epic. I did not think too much about it. Little did I know what a s\*it show (pardon my language) our nurses would be dealing with when going live.  1.) For whatever reasons, the person that's in charge of the Epic training had ZERO experience in IT. ZERO. One undergraduate degree in communications and a master's degree in communications. She had never been to WI to get Epic training for the clinical application, and she does not have any Epic certification in the clinical application.  I don't understand why she was in charge of this training project when she had neither IT training/experience nor clinical training/experience. The other nurses and I were confused.  2.) The trainer that's training us in the classroom was not even a nurse. However, the leaders somehow though that she's suitable for the training role.  During the training, I was NOT happy with the training materials. The other nurses and I knew that the training materials would not reflect our actual clinical workflows. Sadly, we were right....  Well, when we went live, the leaders finally admitted that it's a disaster. It's so bad that the nurses did not even know how to properly input orders into the Epic application, and the patients were furious. Neither the training manager nor the trainer was fired.  **Epic Implementation for the Outpatient Side**  This time, we're going to implement the Epic application for our outpatient side. The good news is that the leaders are finally willing to use our own instance of Epic. This way, we would not be affected by the other organization's EHR configuration. Our final build would fit our workflows perfectly.  The bad news is that the training environment only mirrors the Foundation System. For whatever reasons, the training manager claimed that her team did not have the time to learn how to do training environment configuration.  The trainer would use POWERPOINT to address the multiple deviations from the Foundation System. I keep telling myself that everything would be fine after 2-3 weeks of going live. However, the leaders need to recognize that we nurses are never given appropriate Epic training. How are we supposed to practice the workflows when the training environment does not reflect the actual build, and we have to refer to PowerPoint slides to understand the deviations from the FS? I highly doubt that the outpatient side would be sufficiently prepared for Go-Live this time, either.  Sigh. Anyway, if you are in the same situation as I am, trust me, we would need to spend much time figuring this out ourselves. After we get a hang of it, it would sort of get better. I have learned not to expect too much from the IT training department now.  Epic has always talked about Nurse to Nurse training, and that's really what I prefer. This training manager and the principal trainer are not nurses, and they are not really IT professionals, either (neither has formal training in IT). The quality of the training could be much better, but the other nurses and I need to face the reality.  **Sorry for the long post. I just have to get this off my chest. I know that the things would get better. However, I sometimes wish that our own nurses could be the ones that fly to WI to get Epic training and design better training materials for the other nurses. Just my two cents....**
Translation idea for the other gamesSo as we all know games 2-4 still remain untranslated aside from having an old school guide next to you as you play.  I am curious though if it would be feasible to instead of going into the code and replacing the English text which caused a lot of headaches to the team of the first game to just replace all the text boxes with  screenshots of the game that have the translated text pasted over them. Almost like an interactive PowerPoint since these game‚Äôs are visual novels   Would it end up making a game that takes up way too much storage space?
How much RAM?Hello! I am about to purchase a 2020 MacBook Air. I have decided I‚Äôm gonna upgrade the processor to the i5, but now I‚Äôm concerned about the ram only being 8gb. I won‚Äôt be doing anything that crazy, just schoolwork, PowerPoints and the occasional photo editing. It seems to me that 8gb has been the norm for quite some time and I‚Äôm afraid that it might not be enough in a few years. I‚Äôd like this computer to last a good 5-7 years so I want to make sure I get the right configuration, but also not spend unnecessary money. What do you think?
The UI / HUD on this game is awful and an embarrassment.First of all this is no hate towards the devs but just something I think they should focus on improving. As making a game not only perform nice but also look appealing when playing or advertising is the best way to keep players interested.   (sorry for long-is post)    Don't forget this is my opinion. Fell free to voice your own.    OK so straight off the bat, the HUD / UI design looks like it was made on PowerPoint an hour before the meeting took place.   The Contrast and design does not match the concept of the game at all. Plus it all seems like it was thrown about and not categorised accordingly.   The constant "You leveled up" after every match is like an itch on the roof of your mouth. Please can we just turn this off? Or have an option to do so, because to be honest I don't care. Even worse when you have the battle pass or completing multiple orders. Yes, there is a skip feature, but even that gets tiresome after a while.   In my personal opinion the layout should match the theme of the game. Keep some of the colours for the factions (Yellow, Red, Green? Blue?) Change the attackers from Orange (really orange? To red, I think the contrast would be much better. And instead of  giant coloured bars across the screen for team players and game points. Replace it with an unfolded parchment scroll. Just an idea.    It just constantly feels like my game is bombarded with button options and sidebars and tabs and it can be hard to look at. (ranting now sorry) Why is it all so big. Please make it smaller of have an option for HUD Customisation: size, colour and placement. The game is over 4 years old I feel like this is something completely overlooked with every update.  Thanks for reading.

iPad for NotetakingI‚Äôve been going back and forth about getting an iPad recently. As the majority of my classes are going online I know PowerPoint lectures will become a big thing. I hate printing out endless pages of slides and using them to take notes. I‚Äôm also an engineering major and require that I do a lot of drawings.   I just don‚Äôt know if it is worth the 600 extra dollars to splurge on an iPad. I spend 800-900 dollars two years ago to get my computer and it works fine.   Not sure if I should just buy it or wait it out till I move on to go get higher education. Any suggestions? Or anyone else do the same thing?

A recommendation for digital writingI've seen a bunch of discussions of digital input tablets for hybrid classes/digital "board work", so I thought I'd make a recommendation: At the beginning of the lockdown last spring, I bought a bunch of different graphics tablets to try them out, but ran into many of the same issues I've been seeing other faculty raise in the comments (unreliable input, "drunken" handwriting even while sober, etc...). Eventually I fell back to using my fifteen-year-old Toshiba tablet PC (that somehow miraculously still works perfectly), with an overhead webcam to capture the action.  The tablet I ended up going with was a  \- it's basically a fancy external monitor that does pen input as well. It's more expensive than the normal tablets (\~$250 US), but it writes great! My "board work" is pretty similar to my "on-paper" handwriting, the students tell me that the quality of the streamed images is much better than the document camera route, and the size of my recorded lectures has dropped from 1.2-1.5 GB to \~600 MB per class. It's been a solid purchase, and I'm planning on continuing to use it in the fall.  I use Xournal++ as the application to "write" on, as I can create a bunch of blank pages before class, and export the result as a PDF afterwards. If I had a Windows machine, I'd probably use the "ink" function in PowerPoint instead on a blank presentation, as that would give a file that's a bit easier to work with in other applications.  Hope this helps! And for any fellow faculty also trapped in what feels like a neverending summer class, salud!

Question on what exactly does a project mean in gitI tried searching online for this but either can't find it or can't express myself correctly. My issue is I'm following a beginner's guid to git, which is seeming to go alright. I downloaded git for windows, made a (empty) repo directory, ran some commands that give my name and email as the global user (I think that's what it meant, with git -config user.name or whatever it was).  I haven't got much further than that, not necessarily because I don't understand what they are saying, and I think I have gotten a basic understanding of why git is useful, even for an individual.  My issue is, I'm pretty new to programming, I'm doing data analysis and making figures with the SciPy stack in python to try to get a paper published for my job as a researcher (not really true data analysis, more getting raw data from 3 years of experiments, cleaning/getting it all together and consistent, and making figures showing the data/stats on it).  The next steps of the git tutorial say to go to your project folder, and either clone it or change things and commit or make a branch or whatever else  (not as sure on that parts since I haven't gotten that far). But what exactly is my project or project folder? Explaining by example, I have folder on my computer for all this python analysis I'm doing, and even though this probably isn't a good way to organize things, its just all separate scripts that do data importing/analyzing/plotting for a particular set of my experimental data.   But that folder also has excel files and text files that contain my raw data. It has some saved figures that I output. It has some powerpoints I put together to show progress to my boss. And probably some other random things I abandoned because I didn't like them.  Sorry for the long post, but is that whole directory what I should be dealing with in the next steps of the git tutorial? Should I have just all of my actual code in one directory and say data in another, figures in another, etc, and only deal with the actual code with git? I think just because I'm teaching myself as I go along, I don't know what the right organization of a project is, if it matters and so forth.

Your go to slide deck for high level planningHello. I've been in the Project and Programme management game for ages so no stranger to many of the do's and don't and some of the chaos in between but I'm so very bored of the usual slide deck I roll out to directors.   I need some ideas for a simple slide deck that has the timeline split across the horizontal and the usual work packages and deliverable down the right. This particular requirement is for a new data centre I'm building so largely waterfall with clear critical path and milestones along the way.   I can of course just build the same old timeline but inevitably it turns out to be just bars and diamonds and the dependencies shown in the usual manner. I'm looking for a new way of displaying this info that will look clean, clinical but will keep the information along the way. Mostly I've highlighted the critical path milestones as it's own dependency flow and that shouldn't change but I think I just want a fresh way of doing this. The audible groan you get when you through your high-level slide deck up is getting louder, especially when people are all at home. The information is all there, I'm just looking for a fresh style.   I use instagannt for the detailed plans and that can roll up tasks but the detail isn't enough. Powerpoint always wins but there must be another way of making these things pop.

Frage zum Abitur-EntzugTut mir leid falls meine frage hier nicht hingeh√∂rt aber ich brauche dringend hilfe.  Ich habe mein Abitur bestanden, nun aber habe irgendwie total angst, dass mir das abi trotzdem entzogen wird. Bei der Pr√§sentationspr√ºfung habe ich tats√§chlich gr√∂√üere Teile aus dem Internet √ºbernommen. Dann wurden die Pr√§sentationen nach der pr√ºfung "eingesammelt" bzw digital eingespeichert. Kann mir die Schule also mein Abi entziehen, falls sie herausfinden sollten, dass es sich m√∂glicherweise um plagiat handelt?  Ich lebe in Baden-W√ºrttemberg  Edit: Quellen habe ich nat√ºrlich angegeben. Es wurden nur meine powerpoint, karteikarten, handout und das protokoll vom lehrer eingesammelt
Can I exchange PowerPoints for gift cards without paying tax?Hello!I'm a 15(f) who wants to make some money on the side. I can't really spend any physical money anywhere because of the pandemic, so I thought- "Why not just try PSN gift cards?"What I want to know is if I'd have to pay tax on it.  I don't know if my location is entirely relevant, but I'm a bit nervous to hand it out.  I also have no idea which flair is the proper one to use.  If it's relevant at all- I was thinking about $1 per 2 slides.  Edit: I guess my location is relevant. Ohio.

Since march i have been learning from home due to the pandemic, the problem with this is that i find it very difficult to do work at home, so much so that i did most of my homework at school. As a result of my laziness i have a lot of overdue work. It's now the summer holidays and my parents believe that i am on top of all my work which is not the case. Telling them is not an option, i am an only child, they are Asian and strict catholics, so they are extremely strict. I need a computer to do  my work, and the only one i can use is in  the living room so my mother can keep an eye on me at all times, even when she is not here my dad is in the room next door and all he has to do is turn around to see me. He works from home however so he closes the door when he is working. But if he just opens the door i won't be able to hide my stuff in time. it's obvious to see I'm doing lessons because i'll use a PowerPoint and my school book so i cant pass it off as studying. My GCSEs are next year and although i will definitely pass, i go to a grammar school so simply passing isn't good enough for my parents and the school. I know this is all my fault but please help me.

Admin Position in QuestionI answered a job posting to a company called Universal Student Learning Center, for a position as an administrative assistant. The site looked legitimate, and the email presented as an honest interest in hiring me at a very competitive hourly rate so I took the job. No interview but in the emails, the HR poster explained that it was a working 4 weeks of probation to see if I was the right candidate, odd but seemed a neat way to try out new hires. A week in and I'm starting to have doubts. The Twitter comments from their site (learningstudentcenter.com) don't match up to anything, there are no BBB reviews, and the company has no media presence, not LinkedIn, or Facebook, not even in Google searches. All I've done so far is send basic bank info (dumb but it's nothing I haven't done for other jobs before), and a photo of my driver's license, while completing a couple PowerPoint presentations. This feels too good to be true and I'm worried that if I wait the 4 weeks, I'll end up losing more than just my time. Has anyone had a similar experience?
Question about Microsoft PowerPoint online vs. Microsoft PowerPoint on DesktopHi all,  I use PowerPoint on my desktop (the Office 365 version) to be exact and was wondering what the key differences between this and PowerPoint online are? Are the differences vast and worth investing time to learn PowerPoint Online separately?  Any knowledge and insight is appreciated. Thanks.

Compilation of research on Extraterrestials, UFOs, and Psychic Phenomena by u/aheadyriser#Hypothesis There exists a relationship between sightings of UFOs, contact with Extraterrestial Intelligence, and Psychic Phenomena. Intelligence agencies across the globe have come to this conclusion and the reason for their silence on these topics is that they still do not have a full grasp on what exactly the implications of these topics will have on the population.  To fully understand this relationship, we must get a grasp on each of these topics individually. #Remote Viewing  ##Project StarGATE   This post is a work in progress.

How do I get into an office job?Hi all! I‚Äôm but a mere couple of months away from becoming regular on the rural side, and i was wondering how it works for applying to office jobs? Is there a waiting period, or can i become a regular and immediately start applying. I have NO interest in being in management, but there are some jobs listed like admin, marketing, etc that interest me in a headquarters nearby.   Has anyone else here done this? What are your experiences? When I started orientation 2-3 years back, the lady giving our powerpoints talked about how cool it was that every year or two she would just move around to a different office position if she got bored. Seems interesting. My main goal is to get away from carrying long term. Are there any cons to this? Is it hard to get in? I applied to USPIS a year ago and they made me go through tons of paperwork and signed letters and all this bs only to leave me hanging without a response after the first few steps. So hopefully the office jobs will be a better experience applying towards.

Designing a Digital PlatformI have a well thought out idea for a digital platform primarily for financial institutions. It‚Äôs pretty complex with a lot of moving parts. For example, in addition to populating fields with data from the user‚Äôs own database, it uses APIs to pull data from third parties which it then compiles, digests, etc.   In any case, I would like to create a document that I can send to a developer so they see exactly what I am trying to accomplish. Sort of like a step by step instruction manual or a blueprint. I started creating an interactive PowerPoint but unsure if that‚Äôs the best way to go about it.   Anyone have any thoughts on this? Ideally, it would be great if I can get a sample of such a document so I can use it as guidance. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.

Office 365 access?Do students still get free access to office apps like excel, word, powerpoint, and outlook? I've logged in with my Baruch email but my access is limited to view only on my Mac for all the apps so I can't complete and save the assignments I need to submit. Is anyone else having this issue?  Also, for CIS 2200 and FIN 3000, what Microsoft apps do students need to have?  Update: Help desk just got back to me. They said need to wait until Summer session 2 registration is finalized on Aug 2 (summer drop deadline) before licensing can be finalized. I'm guessing this is only an issue for new students or those who are activating their Office 365 access for the first time. If you need it for Fall, you'll probably be fine. If you need it now for Summer classes, you'll need to wait until Aug 2 at least.

Microsoft Office?I just recently purchased a new MacBook Air. I need to add Microsoft Office (specifically Word &amp; Powerpoint) but when I look online there seems to be two options, both seem to be...not great.   I can purchase outright, but it won't be updated and is (maybe) missing some features?   Or I can purchase an annual subscription, but I hate the idea of having to fork out $60 a year.  Any recommendations which would be best for a very casual user?

AITA for wanting credit from my bf at work?Hey all, so bf and I are in the same stem PhD program. I‚Äôve given him a lot of tips and comments on how to improve his slides and figuring out ways to make it easier for the audience to understand. Ive put together a small graphic for him (took like 5 minutes but still) and taught him how to use PowerPoint animations to make his talk a lot more lively. His boss loved it and said his PowerPoint was beautiful and improved a lot! I was super proud and happy. She asked how he made the graphics and i overheard him saying he got the free version of bio render so he couldn‚Äôt publish it (not true: he was using my account which I paid for). He helps me with my work too although I think he‚Äôs less willing to help me. When I ask him if a sentence sounds good, he will say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù The times he‚Äôs helped me  on experiments or writing, I bring it up to my PI when I share my progress. Yet he never gives me credit for my help in his work‚Äî even when his advisor specifically asks him to seek my help with design since I love science communication.   This is the specific instance that really got under my skin. On a PowerPoint for a conference talk, his PI didn‚Äôt like his intro slide because it was boring.   I messed around with it for a bit and tried different things and finally what he loved was when I took one of his cool new Neuronal histology images and made it the background and changed the fonts and layout. He told me the next day ‚Äúmy mentor loved it!! Thank you‚Äù   When I talked to her it was obvious she didn‚Äôt know I helped him with it. She texted me that his first slide was so beautiful and that he should show it to me. And I asked him if he told her I made it for him and he said no. I guess I looked annoyed because then he was like ‚Äúwhy are you mad? I‚Äôm so confused.... this is so unlike you what the fuck‚Äù   So anyway, he‚Äôs making it seem like I‚Äôm being petty and he doesn‚Äôt know why I need validation from his boss... she‚Äôs a professor in my department and I would want her letter of rec for a job one day and also I feel weird about him taking credit for things I did. He said I didn‚Äôt make anything, PowerPoint did. That he did all the experiments. I mean yes it‚Äôs stupid when you put it that way, but I just can‚Äôt understand someone compliment something he did and not saying he did it.   I said he didn‚Äôt make me feel like he appreciated what I did since he kept downplaying the time I put into helping him out, and he doesn‚Äôt understand why other people need to know. He suggested that I need to search in myself why I need credit so bad. So... am i being ridiculous? Am i being an insecure asshole?

Need Laptop recommendations. Budget: $500, any advice?Hey I'm just a dude in need of a new laptop that does the basic type of stuff like running a word document easily with minimal lag or being able to make and edit a PowerPoint slideshow without raging over how long the process is taking.   My current laptop (some 2 year old model of an HP laptop) is full of clutter ware and so slow that at this point I've begun to refuse to use it. It's been hard during quarantine but me and the old gal were able to pull through despite the amount of technical difficulties I'd faced during online classes.  So like the title suggests, please could I have some laptop recommendations? Thank you all in advance!
How to make a study plan + take good notes?Tldr; Tips for making a study plan, and how to take good, concise notes?   I'm week three into another semester of uni, and I haven't even finished taking notes from my first lecture. Usually, the week before school commences, I'm getting up early and getting into the groove of studying. However, due to the plague and other life stressors, I've fallen a bit behind. Had a quick vent to a friend this morning, and mentioned that I crave that feeling of being all caught up and waiting for next weeks content to come in. He said "Craving that feeling is different to being dependant on it", and I can't argue with that flawless logic. I seem to insist on writing EVERY word from EVERY slide in the powerpoint, even if it's common sense or not super important. This is NOT efficient, and is stressing me out. However, I've been caught out studying for exams before though, because my ego decided "ha, I know that off by heart, no need to write that down" only to find out that SPECIFIC line was a question.  I really love the content I'm learning, too! And I actually get happy chemicals from learning and writing and doing school assoc' things...just, my brain is overcomplicating things.  Edit: Deleted and reposted for more clarity and to better align w/ the ruru's xx

Usually, the week before school commences, I'm getting up early and getting into the groove of studying. However, due to the plague and other life stressors, I've fallen a bit behind.

However, I've been caught out studying for exams before though, because my ego decided "ha, I know that off by heart, no need to write that down" only to find out that SPECIFIC line was a question.

Late 2009 iMac 21.5 inch still worth upgrading? Hi all! I just upgraded to a gaming PC after using a late 2009 iMac 21.5 inch for 5 years. It runs pretty slow, basically can only handle 1-2 tabs of chrome and exclusively Word, Excel, Powerpoint and the Apple equivalents of those. My brother mentioned that he needed a desktop to use and I‚Äôve been considering upgrading it for him. The only problem is I‚Äôm not sure sinking any money into RAM and other upgrades is worth it on this old of an iMac. The other option would be selling it but don‚Äôt even think it has resale value. Let me know what you think. Thanks!

Art course recommendations for scientific graphic design Hi! I'm a PhD student in the Mechanical Engineering Department an I'm trying to get better at making renders of 3D models for scientific figures. These figures would be incorporated as part of journal articles, grant submissions, Powerpoint presentations, etc.   Right now I use SolidWork's built-in tool PhotoView360 which is working ok, but I'm looking to really step up my game with vector programs like Inkscape and/or Illustrator. I feel is is super important to be able to clearly and pleasingly convey my ideas to both scientific and broader audiences, and have always found it easier to understand ideas when they are accompanied by a well-executed 3D render or diagram.  Any course at CMU y'all can recommend? I am also looking at free online courses on the general interest as well as courses through  that we get for free as CMU students. Any and all advice is welcomed!
Stutters and two questions about Botw (I'm new to cemu) Followed tutorials and I could download and set up both cemu and Botw, patch+dlc and all. In fact it runs and pretty well too (60fps with fps+++).BUT it stutters a lot using OpenGL due to the shaders compiling every other step (powerpoint level stutters). So now I ask you:  1. where can I find a complete shader cache for Botw (update 208, dlc 80, should be around 11073 shaders(?)) ?I already checked on the cemuchach library but it only has a chach for the 1.4 version and around 9000 shaders.Also, do i put it in shaderCache\\transferable or shaderCache\\precompiled? does some sort of compatibility between caches have to be respected? I tried copying one (about 500mb) I found but it just self-deleted (and went back to 3mb). how big should a complete cache be? 2. Bsod said in one of his latest videos that Vulkan doesn't have this shader compile problem, but is MUCH buggier, is any of it true? should I switch to vulkan? I haven't been enough time in the cemu scene to know how that would help and what would be different ingame. 3. quick one, I've found online Botw caches named 00050000101c9400.bin BUT my personally compiled cache is called 00050000101c9500.bin with a 5 not a 4, why is it? are they interchangeable?  setup:i7 7700gtx 1060 6gb16gb 2400mhz

Say I want to insert 50 jpgs (basically powerpoint slides) into one note. Is there a way to set all of them as a background instead of manually right clicking each one? The goal is to annotate the slides differently. I've been able to do this but have to manually click each jpg and set as background which is a tad (read: a lot) annoying.     Otherwise this one note thing is growing on me.

How do you deploy code to non-programmers? I have created my first python script to automate creating a load of reporting graphs for a colleague at work.   Nothing too complex, finding a source file, creating a data frame and plotting a series of graphs and saving the images in a separate folder (I will look to improve by creating a PowerPoint slide too in the future)  I want to handover this script so he can run it each week when needed, what would be the best way to go about this?   Thanks!

Super random question. I'm seeing a new psychologist and psychiatrist next week. What should I put in a fact sheet or PowerPoint presentation to show them? I'm just extra af. I figured why spend so much time talking about something like a self intro if I could just condense it into well thought out words?  Besides, I'd like to be as interactive as I possibly can with them haha.

How to make a study plan + take good notes? Tldr; Tips for making a study plan, and how to take good, concise notes?   I'm week three into another semester of uni, and I haven't even finished taking notes from my first lecture. Usually, the week before school commences, I'm getting up early and getting into the groove of studying. However, due to the plague and other life stressors, I've fallen a bit behind. Had a quick vent to a friend this morning, and mentioned that I crave that feeling of being all caught up and waiting for next weeks content to come in. He said "Craving that feeling is different to being dependant on it", and I can't argue with that flawless logic. I seem to insist on writing EVERY word from EVERY slide in the powerpoint, even if it's common sense or not super important. This is NOT efficient, and is stressing me out. However, I've been caught out studying for exams before though, because my ego decided "ha, I know that off by heart, no need to write that down" only to find out that SPECIFIC line was a question.  I really love the content I'm learning, too! And I actually get happy chemicals from learning and writing and doing school assoc' things...just, my brain is overcomplicating things.
How do you roll back an update on red dead 2 hey guys so the recent update for online came out, great... so now my game is completely broken. i'm experiencing crashes at startup, infinite loading screens and some general weird stuff happening the one time it did decide to load in, namely buildings flipping up and down constantly, missing textures and fps comparable to a powerpoint presentation. the game was working fine right before the update rolled out but now i can't play story mode because of some dumbass update i don't even need. i've done all the necessary troubleshooting as well as reinstalling the game. to no avail. that's why i'm asking for help here to roll back the update to the previous one. i know how to do it on steam but unfortunately i have the rockstar version of the game, anyone know how to do it?
Doctor student unsure between MBP and Ipad Pro 12.9‚Äù **Hello everyone! I am another person wondering if the Ipad Pro12.9‚Äù with the Magic Keyboard is better than the Mac Book Pro 13‚Äù.**     I would like to preface that I own a 2019 13‚Äù MBP, a 2017 21.5‚Äù iMac, and a 2017 9.7‚Äù Ipad  I am entering my doctorate in human geography/urbanism in the Fall. These are the program I use on my MBP and IMac:  \-Microsoft/Excel/Powerpoint   \-Antidote (french grammar program)   \-Google Drive/Sheets/Docs  \-Sometimes SPSS (statistics software)  \-Sometimes Nvivo (coding software)     I figure that it may be useful to purchase an Ipad Pro as I will be correcting many assignments from students due to my TA position. Right now, I use my current ipad to take notes, correct, and read but I find the screen too small. I figure I might as well combine both the Ipad and MBP to get their core functionalities in one And use my iMac for more intense work.      I‚Äôm currently borrowing my partners Ipad Pro 2018 with keyboard to gage whether I would like it or not. I currently love it! But I‚Äôm very much so the ‚Äúoooh shinny‚Äú type of person so I have trouble figuring out if I truly love it or if it‚Äôs Apple playing a trick on me.  I should note that I like the whole streamlined experience: once an app is open, my attention is better captured than a bunch of stuff at the same time like the MBP.     That being said, what do you think? Anybody else here completing their doctorate/writing extensive documents that use the Ipad Pro? Should I simply get another cheaper but bigger Ipad? Any comments appreciated.
One reason to be sceptical about the latest articles Everything is based on the Pentagon's AATIP (2007-2012) that had a $22m funding. When they refer to government study, they aren't talking about the one that began in 1947 in secret and ridiculed the public for daring to think otherwise. They are not talking about the conspiracy theory you have wrestled with for all these years, but instead a half-baked, unserious study started by Harry Reid.  The man leading that program for most of its shelf-life, Luis Elizondo, ultimately left because he felt the subject wasn't being taken seriously enough. He **never** went as far as saying there was conclusive proof that these UAPs were extraterrestrial, much less that the program had recovered materials that were "off-world made". In fact, the programme was to study what these objects could hypothetically be.  Enter Eric Davis and company.  The only **new** assertions are by a Eric Davis (‚Äúoff-world vehicles not made on this earth") and a Powerpoint slide that remarks something similar associated to Dr Puthoff (now at TTSA). Leslie Kean, one of the authors of the report, said this slide originated from the Pentagon's AATIP program in-house.  It brings up a few questions.  * How would a programme that cost $22m be able to unearth a secret that the military has retrieved UFOs and someone able to share this in PowerPoint slides that were not classified? * Why would Elizondo describe the program as not taking the subject seriously and abandon it if the project had knowledge about exotic materials being retrieved?   We're getting excited by something said by Eric Davis and Dr Puthoff, a parapsychologist. Although I welcome any investigative reporting on the UFO subject, we shouldn't confuse statements by subcontractors (who unfortunately have questionable publications/interests that do nothing for their credibility) as disclosure by the US government.
Separating the animations to occur ad-hoc I will pay you to help me figure this out..I've been at this the whole day.  &amp;#x200B;  I would like 10 text items on the same slide to disappear when clicked on. At the moment, it looks like the only way for this to occur is to have them in order. But I would like them to disappear when ever I click on them. I'm very close to begging..:(

Weapon farm guide for next season for weapons that arent being sunset! Hi everyone! For the last few days i have been working on a list of all the different legendaries that arent being sunset the next season. I think i got the majority of them, maybe a couple slipped through. I did this as i wanted to see which weapons i wanted to go out and farm and i figured why not share it on my clan discord and here too. I didnt format it the prettiest, i just wanted to get the information through. I was kind of suprised on how few weapons there are going to be available for high level activities next season, especially machine guns just yikes. It has all the legendary weapons, the max level they can be infused too, what element they have, the archetype the weapon falls into, and where to get the weapon (if it is still possible). At the bottom of each slide i summarised if any archetypes are missing and if any elements are missing. This is not a rant post against sunsetting its more of a guide for us to find out what to farm. Also make sure you check the max power on your iron banner weapons, and bad omens as some of them are at a maximum of 1060 compared to the ones you can get now, which arent being sunset. The link will send you to the pdf! I put it all in a powerpoint which i formatted into a pdf to share with you guys (because powerpoints are amazing). I hope you find it helpful!

Guide of weapons to farm for next season! Hi everyone! For the last few days i have been working on a list of all the different legendaries that arent  being sunset the next season. I think i got the majority of them, maybe a couple slipped through. I did this as i wanted to see which weapons i wanted to go out and farm and i figured why not share it on my clan discord and here too. I didnt format it the prettiest, i just wanted to get the information through. I was kind of suprised on how few weapons there are going to be available for high level activities next season, especially machine guns just yikes. It has all the legendary weapons, the max level they can be infused too, what element they have, the archetype the weapon falls into, and where to get the weapon (if it is still possible). At the bottom of each slide i summarised if any archetypes are missing and if any elements are missing.  This is not a rant post against sunsetting its more of a guide for us to find out what to farm. Also make sure you check the max power on your iron banner weapons, and bad omens as some of them are at a maximum of 1060 compared to the ones you can get now, which arent being sunset. The link will send you to the pdf! I put it all in a powerpoint which i formatted into a pdf to share with you guys (because powerpoints are amazing). I hope you find it helpful! -Bear  Here is the link on docdro-

PPT Copypasta Database Now that Amane Kanata has become an official mod of this subreddit, I want to celebrate the occasion by unveiling something I've been working on the past few weeks: PPTenshi Copypasta. You may have seen me post these on Kanata-related posts recently. To demonstrate:  &gt; PPT, aka Power Point Tenshi, is a Hololive vtuber who is often praised for her innocence and purity. She is specifically known for using PowerPoint presentations on Youtube streams and being cute.  This copypasta is based on the LS copypasta for League of Legends personality LS. The use of an acronym allows this copypasta to be adapted to many different situations. For example, in regards to Kanata's latest stream with Coco:  &gt; PPT, aka Penny Pincher Tenshi, is a Hololive vtuber who drops ¬•5000 to assert dominance over her friends. She compensates the spending by refusing ¬•5 bags at the bakery and not taking the train home.  Copypastas can become annoying and low-effort, but I think this specific format allows for a lot of creativity. They are a lot of fun and are a great way to reference memorable memes and moments.  And yes, as the title indicates, I have an entire spreadsheet of these.    I've been working on these as the inspiration comes. They are all designed to be 200 characters or fewer for easy posting into Youtube live chat. I am open to suggestions and new submissions, and I'm constantly on the lookout for good PPT acronyms. I hope these are as fun to look at as they are for me to create, and maybe encourage some healthy and supportive memeing of our favorite vtubers.
People with shit internet should be banned from playing this game online When you select online, the game should do a speed test for your internet, and if it's too slow it should say "fuck off go play tetris until your shitty tesco wifi is fixed."  Im sick of joining a match just for it to turn into a powerpoint shitshow, it's often on me to end the match early by SD'ing, then the game has the fucking audacity to tell me to refrain from unsporting behaviour? Lol fuck off Nintendo.

Someone thought I was a manager, because I ask sensible questions. Anyone else seem to have people think they‚Äôre in a position of power for basically being competent?   I work in a department store as a brand rep (it‚Äôs horrifying. If you have any jobs going that I can do from my computer please hire me, I‚Äôll love you forever). I‚Äôve been on furlough since the end of March, but I have to go back on Thursday, so we had an all day Zoom meeting today.   The whole thing was basically them reading us a PowerPoint (which in itself annoyed me because I read a lot faster than you do and could have finished this 8 hour experience in about 90 minutes), but I had questions about almost every section. This was mainly because I‚Äôm a hypochondriac with anxiety and low level agoraphobia so I really don‚Äôt want to go back unless I‚Äôm pretty much certain I can avoid people and stay safe.   At some point I also posted in the chat asking people to fucking mute themselves because the background noises were giving me a headache.   Anyway, because I gave directions I guess people thought I was in charge, because I got a loooooong WhatsApp message asking me to do a million things I have no authority to do (reset their password and reallocate a shift).   It was weird, but also not the first time this has happened. Like another time at my *second ever shift* I was made an emergency assistant manager/bar manager. Still minimum wage, of course, but something I‚Äôd said convinced them that my having been a waitress for a year at a different place meant I could run a bar. Nobody broke anything, and I think the till balanced out, but I was so panicky every time someone needed direction‚Ä¶ like cut up some limes‚Ä¶ I guess? Wait, no, you‚Äôre 16. Go swap places with an older waitress, you can‚Äôt be here.   My introversion makes it really hard for me to actually want any level of responsibility in vet other people, but my fast brain always asks too many questions to the actual managers which seems to make people think I‚Äôm more important than I am.

LPT if you need to copy something into for example a Word document, PowerPoint, email, and want to remove the text formatting, font, color, size, etc paste it into the URL bar of the browser. Then you can just copy the text from the URL bar again, this will "clean" whatever you paste to clean text A pro tip i have for this is to use shortcuts, just follow these steps:  1: Mark whatever text you want to copy  2: Press: Ctrl + C (this will copy the text)  3: Press: Ctrl + T (this will open a new tab in most browsers)  4: Press: Ctrl + V (this will paste the text into the URL bar)  5: Press: Ctrl + A (this will mark all the "cleaned" text in the URL bar)  6: Press: Ctrl + C (this will copy all the marked text)  7: Press: Ctrl + W (this will close the tab with the "cleaned" text  In other words, just hold Ctrl and press (in order): C-T-V-A-C-W  Now you are free to paste the cleaned text wherever you want!:)

Best Note Taking Tablets? I found out that my fall semester classes are all going to be online. I usually like to print the PowerPoints and write on them but because I can‚Äôt print at school I can‚Äôt do that. I was thinking about getting a tablet to take notes on instead to save paper. Anyone have any recommendations?

Not me, but my friend's boss is practically evil. He tells me stories of his boss, and some things sound illegal. I would like to know, if he had evidence, could he get his boss fired, for these? (Edit): Oklahoma, at a Christian church summer camp   1. Sexual harrassment - His boss, ( B ) repeatedly humiliates, and practically gropes his secretary in front of his partners.  2. Moonlighting - B has a second job as a preacher, and uses company time and resources by forcing his secretary to type up hour long sermons and powerpoints on company time.  3. Missing payments - My friend sometimes doesnt get paid for 2-4 days after his contract states (he gets paid twice a month) That is because the secretary (who is already overworked) gets verbally harassed if she sends out checks without B's permission. B then "forgets" to tell her to pay the employees.  There are a lot more things B does that arent fireable, ( like double booking events without notifying anyone, and recently, personally ignoring most covid-19 precautions. ) but I need to know if he has any grounds to take legal action.

[POWERPOINT] PowerPoint 2019 macOS - Some controls on this presentation can't be activated. They might not be registered on this computer. I downloaded a .PPTM file and once I opened the file, I received the following message:  **Some controls on this presentation can't be activated. They might not be registered on this computer.**  It also said it was not able to transfer all the macros.  The .PPTM tile has ActiveX Element: Label. It has a few trigger animations and macros to manipulate the Label.  Please advise on how to proceed. I am using PowerPoint 2019 on macOS.

Tablets for taking notes? (not iPad) Hey guys! Just wanted to get your opinion on what's the best tablet for taking notes on a Mac (maybe on OneNote?? also taking suggestions for different programs). I considered the iPad/Apple Pencil briefly but if I'm just trying to annotate PowerPoint slides, I couldn't really justify spending that much.    I'm looking most for palm rejection, smooth writing, etc. Please also list some good ones you think are more affordable (if not the same price range as "the best") if any come to mind.
Best setup for teaching and sharing the desktop with Zoom..? Zoom can share Ubuntu's desktop. For teaching, I want to show (1) webcam (2) powerpoints (3) software; but preferably nothing else. I would like to remove the top window bar and the dock; but they should reappear also when I need them. Also, I want to present my webcam and powerpoints frameless (no bars on the top or sides), but I also want to keep usability. Any suggestions from you experts about what my best bet here might be?
Reviewing PowerPoint slides after a lecture/presentation is not a replacement for taking notes during the lecture/presentation. I appreciate if the slides are posted somewhere after the presentation where you can review them after, especially if there is extra content or external links to more information. But I‚Äôve had so many presenters highlight how there is no reason to take notes on the presentation because the slides will be available after the presentation. Taking notes keeps me focused and engaged, and I don‚Äôt always want to take an extra hour reviewing every lecture I sit through once I go home when a few quick notes will jog my memory of the highlights.

To wait or not to wait.... that is the question Basically: I‚Äôm debating buy a new MacBook  Current MacBook: MacBook Pro 13‚Äù mid-2012 bought new in 2014. 2.5 GHz intel i5 4GB RAM. Battery health app says it has 49% capacity and is just under 1500 cycles.  It has good days where it runs smooth. But the bad days are bad. It moves so incredibly slow and runs hot and seems like it is working so hard and a few times it has even self restarted on me. Of course these days are usually when something important is happening like online class. I‚Äôve also had a scare recently where I thought it died during quarantine but after a half hour I was finally able to get it back on and haven‚Äôt had any similar issues since. (I‚Äôm also tired of having to buy almost $100 MagSafe chargers when they give out too)  What I use it for: mainly school (I‚Äôm in grad school earning my DPT and have 2 years to go). I use google drive for assignments and downloading class PowerPoints and also taking notes for certain classes. Also in these times it involves zoom class meetings. I tend to watch a lot of YouTube that involves many tabs. And very occasionally play Sims 4 and Toontown.  Options:  1. New 2020 intel MacBook Pro 13‚Äù base model     1. I‚Äôm concerned about heating issues (hence why the air has been nixed) and support not lasting as many ‚Äòyears‚Äô as people say    2. I‚Äôm pulled in by the current AirPods deal at the education store 2. New apple silicon MacBook Air or pro    1. I‚Äôm concerned about it being a 1st gen product 3. Crazily wait for 2nd gen apple silicon MacBook    1. I‚Äôm concerned about this timeline  Obviously if my MacBook dies in the meantime I will just buy one no problem. But after so many videos and reading so many thoughts these past couple weeks I still feel lost on what choice is best and would like any and all input
Still Struggling with Optimal Study This 5 week anatomy and physiology class has definitely kicked my butt. It's taught me I really need to learn how to retain and study better. Im doing okay but Im really just going all out to do my best and constantly feel like Im barely keeping my head above water. I bought Anki and I think Anki is awesome but it's going to take a little practice to figure out how to use optimally. But within a 5 week class it just takes too much time to make good decks. I usually just look up pre-made quizlet decks and hope for the best. My main question today is what is the best way to learn and retain information from a slide. For example, lets say out of your class powerpoint, you have a slide (probably have 50-70) but lets just focus on one for now; this slide has 5-6 pieces of information on here you should memorize. What is the best way to get all this to memory and then do the same for all the other slides? If it‚Äôs Anki, how are you setting up your questions? I know we all learn differently, I just want to hear some ideas.
Happy/relief cried I won‚Äôt see my parents until at least next year Today I happy cried because I don‚Äôt have to see my toxic parents until at least next year thanks to the current travel ban  As an only child, in my opinion, it‚Äôs difficult to cut your parents off. My parents were always physically and emotionally abusive so we‚Äôve never had a good relationship although my mother thinks we have a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù relationship. Anyway, I was messaging my dad (who I get on with a lot better than my mother) about random stuff before I asked when it was looking like they were coming over. To which I got the greatest response I could have asked for ‚ÄúThe non travel ban is currently upto the 31st December. An exemption to that is parents of permanent resident holders but they have to be single and under 21. So we're currently waiting until 1st January. Problem is it maybe extended‚Äù and I burst in to tears because I was so relieved.   A few weeks ago I sent them a PowerPoint about my mental illnesses and they‚Äôre still very anal/not understanding of what I‚Äôm actually going through as a result of the trauma I went through   I‚Äôm currently medicated (which they hate) and progressing with therapy. Knowing that I am able to continue the work on my mental health and be without any issues is such a blessing. I cried because I‚Äôm safe for longer and free of negativity. I am so thankful and overjoyed that I can continue to progress and be happier  This is just what I needed to make me realize all the pain and suffering has been worth the battle to be better

Is it worth attending PHYSL 210 lectures? Since high school, I‚Äôve known that I‚Äôm not an auditory learner. Going to lectures where profs simply read off the powerpoints does nothing for me and is a waste of time that I could be using to study on my own and actually learn. Are PHYSL 210 lectures just the profs reading ppts, or do they test stuff that is talked about in lectures but not in the ppts/textbook? Thanks!

Stable but not appreciated or fulfilled, what should I do? (21F from U.K. recently moved back after living abroad since 18) I am currently working in a new job I started in March. I am an ‚Äúoffice assistant‚Äù but my job entails so much more than what is in my office JD. The pay I get is average for an office assistant but I don‚Äôt feel like it is accurate for what I actually do in the role, here is everything I currently do on a daily basis:   Manage the CEO and operational director‚Äôs diary, organise and prioritise daily workload, make appointments, coordinate reservations, send RSVPs to events and schedule and assist with meetings as necessary ‚Ä¢ Complex and seamless international meeting organization across different time zones ‚Ä¢ Document production using MS suite including advanced formatting and embedding in word, powerpoint and excel ‚Ä¢ Main contact for 30 + nurse contractors ‚Ä¢ Managing payroll for 30+ nurse contractors ‚Ä¢ Formatting and file management of patient files and medical records ‚Ä¢ Managing expense reconciliation and finance logs for office staff of 10. ‚Ä¢ Allocation of nurse contractors into patient jobs ‚Ä¢ Management of mandatory training requirements and tracker for nurses and employees ‚Ä¢ Build and maintain strong relationships with UHNWIs ‚Ä¢ Draft and prepare presentations and correspondence for staff members ‚Ä¢ Assist and lead on new starter onboarding ‚Ä¢ Carry out compliance audits to ensure we are meeting regulatory requirements outlined by CQC  There are many jobs that have the same duties but pay 50% more.   So here is my dilemma:   A) do I stay in my role and try to negotiate? My new ‚Äúboss‚Äù, who started last week and I have been training,  does the EXACT same role as me and earns 40% more (she has no extra experience in the industry than me).  B) stick out the job, get the experience even under the title of ‚Äúoffice assistant‚Äù and then move to higher paying role in 1/2 years   C) move industry completely into legal industry (which I am currently studying online)   Any advice would be appreciated!   Thanks
I wish that every new relationship has to be legally established through a job interview Explorative, superficial dates are fine, but if you want someone to be your SO, you need to have a job interview with them, including questionnaire and powerpoint presentation.

In my PowerPoint it‚Äôs spelled ‚Äúepitheliod‚Äù and ‚Äúepitheloid‚Äù, which one is right??? When I google it I get ‚Äúepithelioid‚Äù which never appeared on the presentation and seems to be referring to something else... please help!!

Presentations over Discord Hi, I am part of a group currently planning frosh for our faculty. Part of frosh includes mandatory presentations to the entire class at once (250ish people). Because of the current coronavirus pandemic, frosh is going to be online, and by extension the presentations. We have started working on a discord server where we will host all of the networking and mingling activities, but we are still looking at how to best deliver the mandatory presentations. We have set up a voice channel, with permissions set such so that only a specific user is able to speak and share video, while everyone else can only join and listen. Would it be possible to deliver the presentations in a live-stream fashion to at least 200 students in a manner similar to twitch? Video will be necessary, powerpoint presentations are going to be provided as well.

[Question] Clueless about video production, editing Hi,  I made my first attempt at a Youtube video sometime this summer, 6-8 weeks ago. Won't post here for anonymity unless advised, then I'll come back with an alt. It was political commentary although not too inflammatory, I don't think. I've left it public and a few of my friends like it, but my channel hasn't grown at all and I think the video was ignored.  I faced 3 issues:  * I tried to quote an extended passage from the book I was commenting on (3-5 pages or so?) This might have been too long for viewers to follow, and also I was worried about copyright fraud etc. One friend said that it was interesting but possibly too 'academic' and that I probably needed to teach the ideas and thinkers discussed in the video from scratch rather than assuming the audience knew what the author was talking about  * I was ad libbing my initial thoughts, which meant it got a bit long and rambling (40 mins, which is probably too long for a first video)  * I don't know how to do video production or editing, so there were e.g. no Powerpoint slides, no music, no opening or outro and so on. I used Windows Camera and I didn't know how to superimpose videos or sound onto it...meaning it was literally just me, the camera and my book.  After all of this and initial feedback, I was hesitant to post again as I feared that my channel would repeat what thousands of others have said. So I got writer's/artist's block and have left it to rot since, but haven't given up on it entirely. It's just the initial hurdle of not treating videos as a place for me to info dump and expect the audience to be able to follow, that's going to be hard to overcome.  Even though I'm fairly solid on my subject matter, I'm obviously a complete beginner on the technical aspects of Youtubing, so any tips you'd have are appreciated.

Best software to create animated presentations and online lessons with multiple choice questions. Hi, I hope this is the right place to ask.

I‚Äôm good at InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro etc but not so hot with After Effects. I‚Äôm happy to learn another program - any ideas? Thanks very much!

National Protection Army Flag Just wanted to share my mock-up of Long Yun's NPA flag. Might be a little off proportion wise, (I just use MS Paint and Powerpoint, and any elements I can get from Wikipedia lol), but I'm happy how it came out.
