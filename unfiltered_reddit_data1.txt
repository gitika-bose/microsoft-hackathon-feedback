How to come out to grandparents? I want to introduce my partner to my grandparents. I am cis bisexual man. My partner is a trans bisexual woman of color. My white grandparents don’t yet understand gender identity, sexual orientation, or intersectional identities. They are sweet, but VERY conservative. I believe that they will be interested in learning about LGBT+ stuff, but are currently very ignorant.   Any advice on where to begin?  I’m making a PowerPoint for them right now that explains some of the basics.

How to play sound files over non-consecutive slides in Powerpoint 2016? Hi guys, i need your help. I have a PP-presentation where i jump a lot while presenting (from slide 1 to 12 and back to 3 lets say). I want a sound file playing over non-consecutive slides and then stop. This was possible in earlier versions but not in newer versions of powerpoint it seems.  example: I am on slide 1, a soundfile starts playing, then i move to slide 12 with a button click, the sound file should still be playing. After slide 12 i go to slide 3, sound still playing. Then to slide 4, the sound should stop. Is something like that possible somehow? Thanks for your replies!

Issues when trying to attach, upload or use the file elsewhere when open Hi All,  Hoping that people might be able to help with this slightly strange one. I've suddenly found that when I am in an Office 365 document (Word, Excel or Powerpoint), I can no longer attach, or upload the file when its open, even if its fully saved.  Historically I could work on a file, save it and then attach it to an email for example, to then send to people. Now when I try to do this I get a message that says "This file is in use. Enter a new name or close the file thats open in another program".   I've never seen this before, and its causing me issues as I then have to close the file, attach and then reopen if I want to then keep working on it.  Has anyone seen this before?

Considering reclassifying to 35F for AGR Good Morning Reddit,  PSG calls me and asks me to apply for a 35F AGR position. 35F is the MOS I originally enlisted as but after speaking with 35F cadre at BCT I changed my MOS after BCT (was split op) and picked another one.   35F was explained to me as basically giving PowerPoint briefs to ranks that I would normally try to avoid interacting with. I like being an 88M but can’t get a deployment to save my life, my friends in MI have deployed several times so that makes it appealing. I do have a TS already.  Any 35F or other intel series AGR soldiers that can give me any insight to the job?  How does going AGR affect drill?   Will I now have to transfer and drill with an MI unit? If I have to transfer is my selection for E5 gone with it too?  How is reclass school for 35F? I’m reading conflicting things that it’s part online part in person, others saying it’s all in person.   Anything else I should know as an M-day soldier considering reclassing for an AGR position is appreciated too.
What factors made custom e-learning solutions a big hit among organizations? Custom e-learning solutions have become a powerful tool of the modern digital learning space. The custom e-learning solution has helped custom e-learning companies in India to end the learning problems that learners faced with the text-based learning mediums such as reference books and learning materials of the correspondence courses.  **Problems faced by the working professionals while upskilling and new inductees during training programs**  Working professionals who wanted to upgrade their knowledge used to enroll in a correspondence course or technical institute. However after returning from the workplace, the working professionals used to find it very difficult to comprehend the heavily worded terminologies and technical jargon used in the textual form, with least examples, in the learning materials. Similarly when various organisations conducted training for the new inductees, some inductees found it difficult to absorb the concepts explained during the training programs, presentation on the PowerPoint slides. The reason for the inability of the working professionals and the new inductees to understand the content present on the learning materials or PowerPoint slides is, primarily, due to the plain text content used for the explanation purpose. The plain text puts a lot of load on the learner’s brain to comprehend rather than explaining them. Thus content in PowerPoint slides and plain text on books posed numerous learning problems for the learners.  **How did the custom elearning solution come to the rescue? What research studies say about the custom elearning solution?**  When various organizations approached different  consider a host of parameters so that the learners find e-learning materials interesting, and they induce further curiosity in the learner’s mind to learn more from the e-learning course-ware.

Doing a sales presentation over Zoom is like doing a pitch in a darkened room... During the week, I did a sales presentation with 3 decision makers of a medium-sized (100 employee) enterprise over Zoom. Conveniently, they all claimed they had no webcams. So, I started my PowerPoint and it really felt like giving a presentation in a darkened room. I stopped the presentation a few times to ask some cursory questions whether X or Y would apply to them and I would hear a "yes" or "no". I also use these questions to initiate a more collaborative pitch (i.e. get THEM talking) but the dynamic of  video link seems to greatly interrupt the transition from going from "talking to them" to "talking with them".  I'm a fairy good reader of body language and often use non-verbal communication cues to alter the presentation on-the-fly but even that option was also cut-off to me. Sales presentations over video link suck. / End of rant.

How can I avoid plagiarism in an exam? I have an exam tomorrow and because of the pandemic it is a home exam, submitted via canvas. The college uses Turnitin to check everything - Everything and the material I have taken the time and effort to understand and to learn is straight from canvas powerpoints, cases (I'm studying law). A while ago, I submitted some of my own work, taken from the module content but put into my own words to Turnitin and it came back saying it did pick up some plagiarism.  &amp;#x200B;  Argh, I'm getting quite worried now! Because it's law, all the material is precedented stuff, written in books and taken from cases. I can't see any other way around this, any tips?

Looking for a "timeline" program Hi there !   I am an aspiring writer/animator, and I am currently trying to work on a script. I'm a pretty "visual" person, so I'm trying to make a clear, color-coded timeline of my script, with colors corresponding to character arcs etc. I started out simply in Powerpoint, although it's not the most practical in term of time efficiency. But I did manage to make something that looks good, at the very least for my own thought process (the image below).    Despite this mild success, Powerpoint has two huge limitations for my use. First of all, size is limited. The width of the picture is the maximum size of the file, and I would probably between a hundred and two hundred times that size to write my entire script (which is for a series spanning multiple episodes, with many character arcs entertwining).   The second limitation is simply practical : if I want to add or delete a "bubble" in between two others, well, I've got to move every other bubble and arrow manually. Not the most time efficient, especially early on in the process of writing where a shit ton of stuff changes on a daily basis.  And so after weeks of looking online for a program suited for my needs, I have come here, because I seem unable to find such a software (if it even exists).   So thank you all for reading, and thank you to anyone who'd try to give me suggestions, it would be deeply appreciated &lt;3  Toodles !

UT ADHD Accommodations I'm a sophomore and was just diagnosed with ADHD. I'd like to register with SSD so that I can get additional time on tests when needed and access to powerpoints for class beforehand since I have problems with notetaking. I was looking into documentation requirements and was wondering if anyone with experience getting ADHD accommodations could comment. As of right now, I've never done super formal testing. I do however have the following:  \-I did an evaluation with a psychiatrist this month where we talked through my history. I was diagnosed and have been seeing her for a month or so to manage an Adderall prescription.  \-I've been seeing a therapist for a year and have a previous history going to two other therapist throughout middle/high school. My current therapist agrees that I have ADHD and has seen evidence of co-occurring issues that stem from it (depression, anxiety, trouble academically). I currently see her once a week.  My biggest concern is that I will need to do expensive testing to validate my diagnosis. I do have insurance, so there's a possibility I can get partial or almost full coverage. I have yet to look into options since I'd prefer to not do it if it isn't necessary.  My other concern is that I won't be taken seriously by SSD because I have a 4.0 at UT and came out of high school with all A's and a high SAT. I worry that my good grades will be used as proof that I don't need more time. The reality is the I have these grades because I Q-dropped 2/5 courses in the Spring. The courses that I remained in gave students more than enough time for exams. The courses I dropped were dropped because I couldn't finish my exams on time despite knowing the course material well.  Sorry, I know this is a lot of info. If anyone has input/is willing to share their experience, I'd greatly appreciate it.

Saving slides as High Resolution images (Power Point v16.39 on MAC) HELP Hi PowerPoint Community! I create a lot of press kits and instagram posts using Power Point. Due to the sheer volume of content I'm required to produce, I usually stick to Power Point over any graphic design program because it allows me to quickly scale what is needed. That said, is there any way to export slides as images in much higher resolution? I'm currently exporting Instagram posts at 1080x1080 and then press kits at 1920x1080. Is there any feature or tip I'm currently overlooking? Thanks!
The Beauty of Catholicism Can I just say that I love being Catholic. This is a wonderful faith rich with intellectual tradition, ration, emphasis on both Faith and Reason, and most importantly the teaches of Jesus Christ.   I love how our masses have a bigger picture and mean something. They tell us the story of Jesus and allow us to walk in his shoes each sunday and calls us at the end to go forth and peace glorifying the lord, so we too may become disciples.   I found visiting a church with my friend called, "Freedom Church". Inside they had a coffee bar and the sermon was given by a man in jeans with 2 big PowerPoint presentation screens while Christian rock was playing in the background. While this is fine, nothing wrong here, to me it lack the depth of a Catholic Mass, especially a Latin Mass.   I don't want to just go to mass to feel good and to be able to hit up the coffee bar during a sermon, no I want to be with Jesus and ponder the mysteries. I love that us catholic meditate and think upon our faith. We have a vast intellectual tradition. During my confirmation classes we were constantly asked about why we are here, what is it to be catholic, why do we want to be catholic. We embrace life's questions and our faith just as Mary did asking God how could she have a child, she was unwed.   I love our roots, our tradition, our worship, our ideals, and I love being Catholic.

25 [M4F] USA - A PowerPoint presentation for you Hello, I know things are difficult now but that shouldn't stop me from asking how have you been? Did anything make you laugh today? Did you help anyone? You know what Kurt Vonnegut said, "We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is. "  I guess it was a useless introduction with lots of talk with no information. Here's a presentation about my interests etc: http://imgur.com/a/Ez4PVup  In case you don't want to click a random link on internet I will tell a few things that are in the presentation. I'm 25, male. I live in US. I'm a physics graduate student. Appearance wise, I'm 5'7", skinny, long black hair. I wear glasses. In my spare time I like to read fictions, cook, watch TV/ movies...You know the usual stuff. I'm not into gaming but don't mind if you are. I'm looking for a relationship. I don't mean to say that I want to get into a relationship immediately. I know that building a genuine relationship takes time. But relationship is my final goal. It should start with getting to know each other.  If you think we might get along please hit me up. Thanks!
Alphabet Logo Trivia Game (Powerpoint Game Shows) When everything went into lockdown, my family was looking for a way to spend time with extended members in different states. I had the idea to create a trivia based game similar to the logo retail game. Now with nearly 8 different versions, my family and friends love the game that has come to be know as "Logo Mania". I have spent a lot of time making hints and bonus questions from scratch. This is just one version of the game (if you enjoy comment and I will post the rest).  I know very little about the capabilities of Powerpoint, and I hope this community can point out some improvements.  I am hoping some of you would try out my game and give me some constructive criticism to improve it. In the link will be everything you should need to get started. Make sure to enable content when prompted and install the Kabel-Heavy font first.  
IT Automated Onboarding What kind of software or tools are you guys using to do for the IT Onboarding for remote people? I’m tired of having to spend so much of my time with each user on their first day just to on board them.  Are you guys recording your on boarding and walking the user through setting their account up in the video?  Are you handing the user a packet or PowerPoint slides?  Only info I can provide is I work at a start up so it’s just me.

Breaking into finance Hey I just wanted to get peoples opinions/feedback on what it takes to really break into the finance industry, specifically the IB/PE area. I'm an electrical engineer who's been in the manufacturing for a little of 3 years now and have realized as time went on that it's what I like doing but, not what I love. I've always had a passion for finance and study various subjects in my spare time but, I am looking to begin fully diving deep into this and focus on switching industries sometime in the next year or so. A buddy of mine ended up giving me his information for wallstreetprep and told me that this is what his firm had them do for the first 6-weeks of employment. It includes the premium package (FS/DCF/M&amp;A/LBO/Trading comps/Transaction comps modeling), accounting crash course, bonds &amp; debt crash course, excel crash course, PowerPoint crash course, and accounting crash course. I've also been looking to get my MBA but, am not sure if it's worth it or needed. What do you all think? Any feedback is helpful!
I've been put in charge of coming up with an online marketing strategy for a university and I feel lost I have recently started an internship for a university that specializes in bakery&amp; patisserie degrees. I am working as a Marketing Intern, the thing is the university has a non existing marketing department and now they have put me in charge of coming up with a marketing strategy to improve their online presence. I feel overwhelmed and don't know where to start, but I'm not in a position where I can risk missing this opportunity because of the Covid crisis. I checked out Youtube and some blogs but it seems like marketing content for higher education institutions isnt that developed. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong place?  I would really appreciate some pointers and examples on where to start and what to work on. I dont even know if I'm supposed to write down a word document or make a PowerPoint to lay out the strategy. Any help is appreciated!
Questions about PP compatibility across different systems Hi everyone!  I am creating a PowerPoint presentation that someone else will be presenting at a business event. I am on Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac, Version 16.39 (20071300). The person who will be delivering the presentation is on a Microsoft PC, but I'm not yet sure what their PowerPoint and system specs are.  What I'm curious about is whether or not the presentation that I save and build will actually look and act correctly on the presenter's machine. I assumed (maybe incorrectly) that since PowerPoint is the most-used presentation software, it would have compatibility across many different systems, but now I'm not so sure.  The presentation in question has plenty of animations as well as a custom font.  How can I save the file in a way that will ensure it displays and animates correctly on the presenter's machine? Should I save it as a presentation (.pptx) or as a show (.ppsx)? Is there anything else I can do to ensure its functionality and appearance is correct?  Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!
Smart object Inception question I am trying to set up a banner, mini banner, icon, power point background, and video thumbnail all using the same stock asset, but scaled different depending on the output mentioned above.  Right now, I have a file set up that when I change one smart object, it makes the change across the rest of the smart objects that are copied and then I can automatically export my banners as needed.  Taking that  step further I want to be able to point all of the aforementioned file types to one smart object that when I change, it populates the change across them all. The kicker is, I want it to retain the dimensions needed (for example, our powerpoint backgrounds are built at 1920x1080, but banners that we use range from 800x250 - 600x1100, and all kinds of wild sizes, so things are scaled differently or placed in the document differently).  In case the above isn't clear, imagine we have a 1000x1000 image as our main smart object. When I place it into the icon, i scale it to 262x146. The same linked smart object is in one of my 800x200 banners, but the smart object is clearly cropped out of the artboard a bit. I am ok with that and want it to stay that way. When testing this, when I made changes to the main smart object, it resized them in the other files that referenced the main linked smart object (when all I did for testing was change the hue).  If anyone can help me wrap my mind around this, or point me in the direction to help me with this, I would greatly appreciate it. The only thing I thought that might work would be to place a smart object inside of another smart object, but I didn't think that'd work. Thanks in advance for any help!

A- shouldn’t exist, an A is an A! I’ve been going strong in my bio 3 lecture course  with a 98%. I have my final exam today so I decided to check out the syllabus again at the grading policy to see if the professor had A- (b/c not all teachers have to use this method of grading, it’s optional). My prof decides to have A- set at 90.00 to 92.99%, I know it’s not the biggest deal in the world but I have to get at least an 80% on my final to keep my 4.0; it’s definitely motivating me to review all my notes/powerpoints but I just don’t think it’s in the favor of the student.

Need MacBook Buying Help Hey everyone! This may not be the right community for this question and if so, I apologize.  I purchased a brand new 13inch MacBook Pro with Touch ID and bar in the summer of 2018 before beginning med school. I intended to make it last until 2022 when I graduate, but I am having a lot of problems with the keyboard. One of my keys constantly gets stuck, another one constantly duplicates itself multiple times. I've tried compressed air, keyboard covers, everything I can think of, but they're temporary fixes at best. I did some reading and it appears that this is the infamous butterfly keyboard issue.  It looks like I can trade in my MacBook Pro and get a $710 credit to put towards (and almost entirely cover) a new MacBook Air, which uses the magic keyboard instead. Will I regret switching from a Pro to the Air? I almost exclusively use my computer for email, Word, Powerpoint, OneNote, Spotify, Zoom/Teams/WebEx, and Epic (medical record software) - no video games, media editing, etc.  I love my Pro dearly, but the keyboard issue is getting very problematic and slowly me down a lot. I'm going to wear down my delete key from all the immediate backspacing I have to do when my "t" key duplicates itself multiple times in one paragraph.

Hi, Im new here, big fan of CatDog, Elite and PowerPoint. And I wanted to share this custom emblem I made in a certain mp game. Its not perfect but I like it. Gonna collect them yubis now. 
Help me. So between pre school and 5th grade i had to change schools 2 times. Because of bullying. And in the 3rd school i went to there was a girl in my class. Everybody hated her. Because she was mean to everybody. Ill call her ig(idiot girl). And she hated me the most. She did this thing where she would hate me and bully me and then be silent until it seemed like i had forgot. So then she would be like a friend and squeeze lies and other crap out of me so she could tell everybody how "disgusting" i was. And she also used to yell alot in the classroom. I am a hardcore gamer and i was then so i talked alot about programming, gaming etc in school. So whenever we had seen a PowerPoint i whould sometimes take up my arm and she would yell "NO STFU NOBODY CARES FUCK YOU RETARD". And that made me so fucking sad and made me lose all motivation to even say anything. And just because i was a lot less stronger than everybody elae she would go around convincing little kids that i was fat. And she would get in alot of fights with me. But she is so fucking bad at fighting it didnt even hurt. And i didnt even want to be at school. I would skip multiple days just to avoid being in the sam classroom as her. Eventually she had to move to another school. Everybody was happy until. My friend who had a little sister at that school told me how ig is telling everybody there that "there is this bully named *my name* that bullied me" and those retards there believed it. And thats how i dont even want to fucking be at school and i want tips on how to not get bullied when i begin high school
Online Classes for IIT JEE: A Blessing in Disguise During Lockdown Getting into IIT is a vivid dream of many for which they put every extra effort along with their regular education. Many coaching institutes have come up in various parts of India over the past years, where students are given specialized classes for IIT JEE preparation. However, the year 2020 has been an exception so far. The coronavirus pandemic has led to the postponement of the JEE Main and JEE Advanced exams. The coaching institutes are also temporarily shut down. All this has not only made students more anxious about their future but has also made it difficult to prepare for JEE.  **• The Rise of Online Coaching for IIT JEE**  This is a crucial time for the whole country especially for the students as their future is at a big stake. However, like a blessing in disguise, online coaching for IIT JEE is proving out to be a promising alternative for the traditional classroom-based coaching. Leveraging the technological advancements of today where a person can connect with a group of others using video conferencing, the offline coaching institutes have commenced IIT online coaching. Teachers are working from their homes, preparing lessons for their students, recording lectures, and providing online video-based classes to the students.   The

Life Insurance Customer Service Hell. Rant I've been at this company six months. This was due to losing my job. I work as part of a large pension/life insurance company. Not directly as I'm employed through a company that manages a specific part of the company.  I'm at my absolute wit's end. To think I believed their promises. The systems are an absolute joke. Archaic. The processes are incredibly labourous. It takes multiple steps to do something that should be simple. Our knowledge system?Yeah no search bar. The names often don't match the exact content. You are expected to memorize where every single PowerPoint is tucked away or you get pulled up for it.  Management don't give a damn about you whilst simultaneously (when top brass appears) pretending to care. The senior management are made up of two-faced back stabbers and borderline sociopaths.  We get tons of wrong calls for other departments. Most of which are impossible to transfer to because they are always busy. So when the lines are closed, we are the ones to be the bearer of bad news.  We are watched like prisoners. Quality assurance emails constantly. Financial integrity email you about the fact you didn't put the customers name in the format they like, even though that is the format on the bank card. I have to sit daily and listen to people tell me they got screwed over by a financial advisor and have to tell them they can't get their money back. Financial advisors (who are mostly clueless about the products which is really concerning) speak to you like garbage and complain about you wasting their time. If you are on a late shift, they expect you to wait until the lines are completely clear before logging out. I've been stuck on for 15 minutes past finish. If lines close, the lines close imo.  Worst of all, due to lockdown, sackings are coming. I'm likely going to be out of a job in the next month. Part of me is glad and part of me is terrified as a parent.  Thanks for listening/not listening

How do you roll back an update on red dead 2 hey guys so the recent update for online came out, great... so now my game is completely broken. i'm experiencing crashes at startup, infinite loading screens and some general weird stuff happening the one time it did decide to load in, namely buildings flipping up and down constantly, missing textures and fps comparable to a powerpoint presentation. the game was working fine right before the update rolled out but now i can't play story mode because of some dumbass update i don't even need. i've done all the necessary troubleshooting as well as reinstalling the game. to no avail. that's why i'm asking for help here to roll back the update to the previous one. i know how to do it on steam but unfortunately i have the rockstar version of the game, anyone know how to do it?
Doctor student unsure between MBP and Ipad Pro 12.9” **Hello everyone! I am another person wondering if the Ipad Pro12.9” with the Magic Keyboard is better than the Mac Book Pro 13”.**     I would like to preface that I own a 2019 13” MBP, a 2017 21.5” iMac, and a 2017 9.7” Ipad  I am entering my doctorate in human geography/urbanism in the Fall. These are the program I use on my MBP and IMac:  \-Microsoft/Excel/Powerpoint   \-Antidote (french grammar program)   \-Google Drive/Sheets/Docs  \-Sometimes SPSS (statistics software)  \-Sometimes Nvivo (coding software)     I figure that it may be useful to purchase an Ipad Pro as I will be correcting many assignments from students due to my TA position. Right now, I use my current ipad to take notes, correct, and read but I find the screen too small. I figure I might as well combine both the Ipad and MBP to get their core functionalities in one And use my iMac for more intense work.      I’m currently borrowing my partners Ipad Pro 2018 with keyboard to gage whether I would like it or not. I currently love it! But I’m very much so the “oooh shinny“ type of person so I have trouble figuring out if I truly love it or if it’s Apple playing a trick on me.  I should note that I like the whole streamlined experience: once an app is open, my attention is better captured than a bunch of stuff at the same time like the MBP.     That being said, what do you think? Anybody else here completing their doctorate/writing extensive documents that use the Ipad Pro? Should I simply get another cheaper but bigger Ipad? Any comments appreciated.
One reason to be sceptical about the latest articles Everything is based on the Pentagon's AATIP (2007-2012) that had a $22m funding. When they refer to government study, they aren't talking about the one that began in 1947 in secret and ridiculed the public for daring to think otherwise. They are not talking about the conspiracy theory you have wrestled with for all these years, but instead a half-baked, unserious study started by Harry Reid.  The man leading that program for most of its shelf-life, Luis Elizondo, ultimately left because he felt the subject wasn't being taken seriously enough. He **never** went as far as saying there was conclusive proof that these UAPs were extraterrestrial, much less that the program had recovered materials that were "off-world made". In fact, the programme was to study what these objects could hypothetically be.  Enter Eric Davis and company.  The only **new** assertions are by a Eric Davis (“off-world vehicles not made on this earth") and a Powerpoint slide that remarks something similar associated to Dr Puthoff (now at TTSA). Leslie Kean, one of the authors of the report, said this slide originated from the Pentagon's AATIP program in-house.  It brings up a few questions.  * How would a programme that cost $22m be able to unearth a secret that the military has retrieved UFOs and someone able to share this in PowerPoint slides that were not classified? * Why would Elizondo describe the program as not taking the subject seriously and abandon it if the project had knowledge about exotic materials being retrieved?   We're getting excited by something said by Eric Davis and Dr Puthoff, a parapsychologist. Although I welcome any investigative reporting on the UFO subject, we shouldn't confuse statements by subcontractors (who unfortunately have questionable publications/interests that do nothing for their credibility) as disclosure by the US government.
Separating the animations to occur ad-hoc I will pay you to help me figure this out..I've been at this the whole day.  &amp;#x200B;  I would like 10 text items on the same slide to disappear when clicked on. At the moment, it looks like the only way for this to occur is to have them in order. But I would like them to disappear when ever I click on them. I'm very close to begging..:(

30 [M4R] Central IL - What does your shirt say and what is your favorite feeling? If your shirt doesn't have words, what does it look like? Here are my answers: My shirt is like an architectural blueprint of some filming studio. I took an online technical learning course and they sent me this shirt that has a blueprint of their building and recording studio. Kind of random since the course and website has nothing whatsoever to do with architecture, but hey it was a free shirt.  One of my favorite feelings is when you get to know someone and become so at-ease around each other that you can have a comfortable silence every now and then, instead of feeling like you always have to be saying something. I worry that we talk too much and quietly experience things too little because we feel that all silences are inherently awkward.  So I'm in central Illinois, which is the not-Chicago part of the state. I love meeting new people, but as I'm sure you can relate to, it's really hard finding people who "get" the CF lifestyle and don't think you're weird for prioritizing yourself and the life you want to live instead of popping out a kid and throwing your dreams away. Even harder in the conservative Midwest.  I'm into finance (shout out to fellow FI/RE-ers), board games, techy things, and am a member of one of the oldest "secret societies" in the world. I work from home in a typical corporate role, so yes I can synergize the shit out of anything and turn a simple idea into three meetings, ten emails, and a Powerpoint presentation. I have  that are definitely cuter than yours.  While I'd love to meet people in the area (eventually and in a safe/responsible manner), I'd love to talk to anyone from anywhere so drop me a message even if you're not local. Please send a regular message (open profile -&gt; More Options -&gt; Send Message if you're on the new reddit layout) instead of doing the Chat thing.  Have a great rest of your Tuesday!
